Quora: How can I know the real name of anonymous question asker?	"Unfortunately, you cannot.
However, there is a method, not infallible, that you can attempt. We used to call it, in the intelligence analysis world, ""Pattern Analysis"".
Everyone tends to use certain words and phrases when they write (or speak, for that matter). Also, when writing people often use certain types of punctuation. I, for example like to use the - to separate and highlight something in the sentence I am writing. So if you study the way something ""Anonymous"" has written, and that question, comment or answer is written in the exact same style that ""Bill Boyd"" or ""Sally Smith"" writes, there is a high probability that they were the Quora poster that actually wrote it.
Some Quora users like myself who try to identify banned Quora users who are back on Quora using fake or false identities often catch them due to ""Pattern Analysis"" and then report them to Quora Moderation.

How does the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer source code work?	"How does the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer source code work?
That Git posting is pure gold; I?õ????ve not seen this much code in an electronic format.
The source is assembly code for the AGC (Apollo Guidance Computer). It?õ????s an arcane piece of hardware, and the code is difficult to understand at best. Colossus was the program that got the spacecraft to and from the Moon, and it ran in the Command Module AGC. A separate program, called Luminary, ran in the Lunar Module AGC.
There?õ????s no operating system. It?õ????s just an infinite loop responding to inputs.
Without knowing about the architecture and the systems the AGC is controlling, figuring out that code is difficult. So, if you?õ????re interested in this, I highly recommend Frank O?õ????Brien?õ????s book
The way they handled the real-time aspects might seem a bit odd, but don?õ????t forget that this was a brand new area. The programmers were working all this out from scratch, without the benefit of established techniques and principles. What they accomplished was remarkable.
Fair warning: I used to design computer hardware and real-time software for industrial and military applications. I still do the software design for my own projects, but I?õ????m quite content to use wonderful microcontrollers from outfits such as Atmel. This is something I enjoy, so you might not be as fascinated with it as I am.

Why was Apollo 11 launched in morning?	"Apollo 11 was launched at 9:32 am Eastern Time on July 16, 1969 because this was the time that marked the ?õ????opening?õ???? of the ?õ????lunar launch window?õ???? for Apollo 11 on that day.
The time for the launch was not ?õ????selected?õ???? as such. The time for the mission that was ?õ????selected?õ???? was the time at which the Lunar Module was to land on the moon. The time on July 20 that was targeted for the LM landing on the moon was driven (primarily) by the position of the sun at Apollo Landing Site #2, on the southwestern edge of the Sea of Tranquility on the moon. The landing time was selected so that the sun was at a particular angle relative to the landing site. The sun angle was picked such that the Lunar Module trajectory would descend ?õ????over top of the sun?õ???? such that the crew?õ????s visibility of the terrain features would be satisfactory.
Working backwards from the intended landing time, the schedule for the crew in lunar orbit (which was practiced and was known) would determine the time for the Lunar Orbit Insertion burn to put the spacecraft into orbit around the moon.
Knowing the time for the Lunar Orbit Insertion burn, and working backwards towards the earth, and knowing the intended time of flight from the earth to the moon (about 66 hours for Apollo 11, I think..), the time of the translunar injection burn was known.
Working backwards from the translunar injection burn, and knowing the crew?õ????s schedule in orbit for spacecraft checkout, the time of launch could be determined.
That time was 9:32 am.
Please understand that the ?õ????mission planning?õ???? process for these things was a lot more complicated than I am portraying?õ???? I am simply trying to give you the basic idea.
Thank you very much.

"If Mamata Banerjee gets to rule for an uninterrupted 34 years like the Communists, what would be the situation of West Bengal in 2045?"	"To face this dreaded question I shudder with the first thought; will it be really possible for Mamta Banerjee to continue as C.M. till 2045?
But since the question has been asked in consideration of Didi's rule in 2045 I think West Bengal ( the new name might be Bengal) will face a P.O.K. like situation because the way Didi is allowing Muslims to come from Bangladesh illegally and subsequently being settled, I don't think that the day is not far away for them to create a political uprising of ?õ???? Right of self determination?õ???? with the help of political support from Bangladesh / Pakistan and money from Saudis. This is going to be dangerous for our nation because the unrest will definitely spread to Bihar and creep up to UP where Muslims are facing great difficulties to carry on many many illegal trade.
The other scenario is a bit satirist. The way Didi is implementing the blind vision on all false notes the days are really near when Ma will be cooking all delicious machher jole and kosa mangso,Mati will yield only gold and since Manush wouldn't have any thing to do but to eat, drink ( as I hear that the government will distribute daru of all sorts and there will no dry day ) and raise their knees like a canon and fart.
Now I shall advise the Bengali Babus to rise against the danger and bring saffron government to ride the wave of development and welfare of our citizens.

Why do so many people have the belief that pitbulls are bad dogs?	"Something people want to ignore, but cannot, if they are intellectually honest:

"Ladies, if your man proposed to you and the ring has gemstones instead of diamonds. Would you still say ""Yes""?"	"Depends on what gemstone it is, carat weight size and quality.
If it is one of the big three gemstones (rubies, sapphires or emeralds) then definitely you should say ?õ????Yes!?õ???ù as I consider high quality ones more rare and difficult to find than a diamond.
Diamonds are marketed really well, definitely not rare and all look pretty much the same in terms of cut. But, high quality gemstones have their own charm by being unique as it is almost impossible to find multiple identical gemstone which has the same color, cut or clarity characteristics.
In fact, if you require a round brilliant, 2 carat D-color, IF-clarity diamond, with top triple excellent make (excellent cut, excellent polish & excellent symmetry) with no florescence ?õ????consider top and rarest quality white diamond?õ???ù - I can forward you 5 to 10 options immediately.
However, if you are looking for top grade, 2 carat ruby like ?õ????unheated?õ???? Burmese vivid red (pigeon?õ????s blood) or 2 carat ?õ????unheated?õ???? Kashmir vivid blue sapphire or ?õ????no oil?õ???? Colombian vivid green emerald - it would be a lot more difficult to find.

Do transgender people really care that much about what bathroom they have to use?	"I could easily answer this question with appeals to reason and appeals to emotion and anecdotal stories to explain my own personal struggles and that of friends on this topic. I?õ????ve done it on many other questions in the transgender topic. I think personal stories and humanizing stories are a great way to explain things that may seem complicated or alternatively unimportant to someone on the outside looking in.
I could try to explain to you the fear as a transwoman of some guy beating me up if I was forced to go into a men?õ????s room. How that quiet, small and often well insulated place can feel like a torture chamber or prison. I can explain the fears that I might not pass well enough when I go into a woman's room and some man will see me going in and attack me without warning assuming I am there for some nefarious purpose rather than to pee and leave.
I could go into details about every single one of those things and fill a paragraph or two about each. But in this case, I don?õ????t have to.
There is clear and objective evidence that yes, transgender people do care and that they have good cause to care. After reading it you can make up your own mind if we care and I challenge anyone who would dispute such.
Overall 59% of transgender persons avoided bathrooms altogether! Not only did they care, they were so paralyzed by the fear, controversy and very real dangers that they went without a bathroom when they needed one! Even amongst those that reported that they can pass as their gender and almost never get outed as transgender 48% sometimes avoided bathrooms. More than half of all transpeople.
A total of 18% had medical consequences from holding it! A third of us avoided eating or drinking to avoid the need for a bathroom. This is not just bathrooms we are talking about. This is why it is such a serious issue. It spills over into quality of life and safety issues.
9% of 28,000 people were denied access to a bathroom in just the last year. That?õ????s 2,520 people denied the ability to pee when they needed it.
12% of 28,000 people were verbally harassed in a bathroom in the last year. That?õ????s 3,360.
1% of 28,000 people were physically or sexually assaulted in a bathroom in the last year. That?õ????s 280 rapes and 280 assaults per year, per 28,000 people.
We are talking about thousands of medical issues like infections, thousands of verbal, physical and sexual assaults. And these are per year! Let me just say that one last time to drill this in. Thousands per year out of just 28,000 people!

What quote describes how you think?	"Technically a wonderful answer, the only answer till now, has been offered by Jim. I may not be able to write anything beyond that unless I take another route.

How is indemnity applied in marine insurances?	"Same way as in any other form of insurance.
Indemnity is the concept of making something whole after it is diminished.
If you insure your cargo, and it is lost, you will be made whole by the insurance - either reimbursed for the cargo, or have the cargo replaced in like and kind.
If you insure your boat, and you run into a smaller boat, your insurance will indemnify the owner of the smaller boat by paying for repairs, or replacing the boat.

"If all irrational numbers are an infinite string, can you assume that at some nth digit, all the digits leading up to it form a palindrome?"	"Yes, there is a position ?õ????n?õ???ù where all the digits that lead up to it form a palindrome.
That ordinal number is ONE. Let?õ????s look at ?è??:
3.141592653589793?õ????
Position 1: 3
?õ????3?õ???ù, just like ?õ????a?õ???ù and ?õ????I?õ???ù, is a palindrome.
There is also the trivial example of irrational numbers that start with 0.000000000000000000000000 before the have their first non-zero digit. I am going to ignore those possible answers. (The first 98 digits of ?è??/100 do form a palindrome.)
BUT no, for any value of ?õ????n?õ???ù greater than one, we cannot make such an assumption. There may be an occasional irrational number that has its first ?õ????n?õ???ù digits make a palindrome, but we can calculate the probability of this, and as ?õ????n?õ???ù grows larger, the probability gets smaller. In order to keep my calculations simple, I am allowing leading zeroes.
n = 1: probability = 100% (examples, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ?õ????
n = 2: probability = 10% (examples (00, 11, 22, 33, 44 ?õ????
n = 3: probability = 10% (000, 010, 020, 575, 797, 838, 929 ?õ????
n = 4: probability = 1%
Can you see why the chances of your palindromic irrational number occurring are practically zero?

What are some realistic ways to get rich in 5 years?	"$200k in 5 years doesn't sound ""rich"" to me, but I'll bite.?ˇ If all you want to do is get rich in 5 years, there's no need to aim high with a venture-backed business.?ˇ What you need is a simple, sales and cash-flow oriented business model.
So, drop ship some e-commerce products.?ˇ With drop shipping, your supplier ships and stores the product for you.?ˇ You don't even pay for it until you make a sale (and collect payment from your customer.
I normally recommend that people use free traffic to generate sales, just by producing valuable content around the web.?ˇ But most drop shipped products don't even need that, a simple facebook ad campaign can turn one product sales page into a money printing machine.?ˇ A machine you put quarters into and get dollars back.
How?
Well, if your gross margin (sales price minus product cost) is $70, and your facebook ads cost $.50 per click, you could sell your product to just one in ten visitors and take home $65 every single sale.?ˇ $70 gross margin minus $5 in advertising equals $65.
Sales volume would only be limited by your advertising budget.
Sounds hard, but it just takes some time and research.?ˇ The other day I spent an hour or two browsing around Etsy, evaluating some opportunities.?ˇ I will reveal one of those opportunities below: a beautiful clock I found someone drop shipping with a sale price of $65, at a cost of $10/unit to him.?ˇ He is making a KILLING.
I've mentioned in previous answers many different places you can source product: Etsy, Alibaba, AliExpress, as well as more obscure, niche wholesalers.?ˇ Etsy is a particularly great place to start for a few reasons...
When browsing through Etsy, your main objective should be to identify products where there is a wide discrepancy between what you would pay to source the product, and the value your customer will perceive in the product.?ˇ This is true for any product sourcing platform, not just Etsy.?ˇ You will heighten customer's perceived value with a brand of your own, great pictures/design, and better distribution channels (Etsy is a marketplace where price is a huge factor for customers, whereas it won't be as important to customers elsewhere).
So, anytime you see a product and think it is priced too low, that's a great sign.?ˇ Of course, there is no set profit margin for Etsy sellers.?ˇ Some will markup 10%, others 300%.?ˇ But chances are, if you think a particular seller is marking up less, they will be more likely to give you a better price and appreciate you helping them sell more product.?ˇ Other Etsy sellers, like the one selling the clock I mentioned above, are drop shipping product from places like Alibaba.?ˇ
It's not a great idea to drop ship product on someone else's platform like Etsy, Amazon, eBay.?ˇ You can make money, but not nearly as much as if you build your own infrastructure, build a brand around the product, and forgo the fees.?ˇ Etsy's audience is limited.?ˇ Plus, you can't retarget visitors with ads to remind them to come back.?ˇ A sale takes 5 exposures to the product on average, so you don't want to be counting on selling to impulsive buyers only.?ˇ People who only see the product once.
When you see a seller drop shipping on Etsy and doing well, like the clock seller, it is a great sign you will succeed independently of Etsy.?ˇ Be sure to pay attention to product reviews and favorites.?ˇ This clock's 4,380 product favorites and 2,509 five-star reviews are a great sign that it will sell like wildfire.?ˇ Reviews and favorites serve as indicators that your customers will be happy with the item they receive, and that the item itself is desirable.?ˇ
You also want to avoid listings where the quantity available is only 1, for obvious reasons.
Beautiful and elegant in style.?ˇ I would expect this clock to fetch at least $90 with its own, independent sales page.?ˇ This seller has it listed for $65 on Etsy.?ˇ It has 4,379 product favorites and the seller has 2,508 five-star reviews.
I was on Etsy looking for product I could source from the Etsy seller, then re-sell on independent sales pages.?ˇ But, the $65 price tag on this clock was suspiciously high for Etsy.?ˇ
The fact that he has had so much success selling this clock at a $55 mark-up so successfully, on Etsy, nonetheless, is a strong sign this clock would perform really well with an independent sales page.?ˇ
You could build an independent sales page for it in just an hour, using this
You would then take that sales page URL, and use it to drive traffic.?ˇ Like I said earlier, normally I recommend writing content, producing videos, etc. and publishing content around the web for free exposure.?ˇ Which is great, and free.?ˇ
But for this clock I could sell on that sales page for ~$90, I wouldn't even bother.?ˇ That's a $70 mark-up.?ˇ I would just run a variety of facebook ads, then delete the ads that didn't work. For the ads that converted, I would ramp the budget up and run them continuously.
You see, Facebook ads might cost you $.50 per click, maybe a dollar, depending on the audience.?ˇ I would put the price of the clock in the ad so it wouldn't scare any buyers off.?ˇ If each click costs me just $.50, I need to convert 1 out of every 139 visitors in to buyers to be profitable.?ˇ
Again, if just 1 in 10 visitors purchased, I would earn $75 on each sale ($90 sales price - $5 advertising cost - $10 product cost).?ˇ The sales volume would be limited only by my daily advertising budget.
These are products NOT being drop shipped by the seller.?ˇ But, you could easily just ask the seller to drop ship them for you.?ˇ See this conversation I had for example...
Margins on bath and beauty items are typically very large.?ˇ The products are cheap to produce.?ˇ It's a product category where
This Etsy seller sells this product for just $3, with 153 five-star reviews and 1,129 product favorites.?ˇ To me, that screams
A facebook ad campaign to your sales page might cost $.50 a click.?ˇ With a $12 margin, so long as you sell one every 20 clicks, you are in business.?ˇ Refine your page to sell one every ten visitors, run enough ads to sell 50 a day, and you're making $350 a day while you sleep.
Another premium, bath and beauty item.?ˇ 1,796 product favorites, 2,495 five-star reviews, and yet it's only listed for $5.?ˇ The product is already branded well, too.?ˇ I think you could probably get this product shipped to your customer for $6, but charge $17.
I can't explain why, but it seems people can't get enough of this fairy dust.?ˇ 6,235 product favorites and 196 five-star reviews.?ˇ The item is listed for $18, my guess is she will ship for a unit cost of $12.
Seems like an excellent opportunity to sell for ~$29 with some facebook ads.
Drop shipping doesn't have to be complicated, nor does picking a product to sell.?ˇ Perceived value in your customers eyes minus product sourcing costs equals your margin.?ˇ So long as you don't use your whole margin on advertising, you've got yourself a money making machine.?ˇ A machine where you put a quarter in, and it spits a dollar back out.

The girl I like asked me if I would rather go on a date with her or another girl. What do I do?	"I am not exactly sure what her agenda is, there are two scenarios i envision. First being that she is interested in you and is being a bit flirty to find out if you would go on a date with her or like her. Second being that she is asking on behalf of her friend(another girl) to gauge if you are interested in her.
In either case, my recommendation will be to indirectly ask her what is the interest of the other person. and what is her interest in this set up.
I personally never prefer to ask someone else to ask on my behalf..am not in high school anymore where this is normal. Non the less
If you find she is interested in you then you can ask her for a date to see how well you guys get along and see how things go
If you find her friend is interested, ask politely to speak to her about it, maybe you find something in common with her( girl No.2)
If you find that both are interested in you?õ????you sir are a fortunate man, in which case you shall have to find a way to date the person you like without causing a breaking of friendship between the two girls if such friendship does exist.
At all times, please be as gentleman and humble as possible
Good luck

Jews are supposed to teach others through their own positive example how to build unity and mutually complementing collaboration in between people above inherent differences, despite the constantly simmering ?õ????baseless hatred?õ???ù, rejecting us from one another.

"The author?õ????s belief that they can help people by publishing their life story is the reason why publishers do not touch autobiographies written by people who are not famous.

"What would be the basic minimum profile that would get you into University of California, Irvine for MS in the Computer Science course?"	"See getting into UCI has been mystery to me.
I would give my personal example, I have applied twice to UCI, the first time I got a reject. My profile then :
GRE :307 GPA:3.2/4.. NO papers or conferences. Just 1 years experience. Just some good projects in undergrad
I applied to UCI the next year with 2 year experience and gre :319. I got an admit.
So in all, I think the profile as a whole and sop matters. Since their ms in cs course is heavily research oriented, I guess they would have given a complete weightage to each and every aspect of the profile. Don't go into the spike in gre scores, I agree a nominal is required to clear cutoff, as I have heard about rejects at way better gre scores than mine.
I suppose your achievements, projects, research work, interns, sop and references(no specific order) .. All will play a role here.
Best.

How does a couple get into foreplay? How do they get started?	"As with most questions about a group of people, the short answer is that it varies. Everyone does sex differently, so naturally their style of foreplay is highly individualized. Some people don?õ????t go for a lot of foreplay at all, while others make it into a whole separate activity.
My husband and I begin our foreplay in many different ways, depending on the circumstances. Sometimes one of us will roll over in bed and just start caressing the other, or we?õ????ll do the same when we?õ????re curled up on the couch together. At other times my husband might come up behind me and kiss the back of my neck while I'm typing notes or cooking dinner.
Since our house is quite large, foreplay frequently starts with a text. I might be in the living room while my husband is in the office, and I'll get a text that simple says ?õ????Blowjob??õ???ù. Or when he is feeling extra romantic: ?õ????Wanna duck??õ???ù. I know, I am the luckiest woman alive to be married to the King of Romance.
Another common way for us to get started is with discreet touching and steamy looks when we?õ????re around other people. You know how it is: You?õ????re at a restaurant with a group of people and you look across at your partner and realize that you'd like some sexy time. So you make a lot of eye contact, play a little footsie, and grab each other?õ????s butts when you finally get up. You make an excuse and hurry out to the car, where you kiss a little before you get in. Every red light is a chance to make out, and bench style seats allow you to stick your hands in each other?õ????s pants. You might even get a head start by giving your man a blowjob while he drives.
My husband and I are silly people, and a playful fight often leads to sex. It usually starts with us gently teasing each other and laughing like crazy monkeys, and then he might pick me up and tell me that he'll put me in the freezer so I'll chill, or I?õ????ll shut him up by covering his face with a pillow. Once you're laughing and in such close proximity to your partner, it is difficult
Sometimes or sex ?õ???? and foreplay ?õ???? simply starts because one of us says that it's time for sex. In those situations we just start kissing wherever we are, and then we?õ????ll either race to the bedroom (or wherever we?õ????re planning on having sex) or walk there holding hands. We almost always undress each other, but sometimes we?õ????ll each remove our own clothes for efficiency. Once we are naked, we get on the bed and start making out.

But since the question has been asked in consideration of Didi's rule in 2045 I think West Bengal ( the new name might be Bengal) will face a P.O.K. like situation because the way Didi is allowing Muslims to come from Bangladesh illegally and subsequently being settled, I don't think that the day is not far away for them to create a political uprising of ?õ???? Right of self determination?õ???? with the help of political support from Bangladesh / Pakistan and money from Saudis. This is going to be dangerous for our nation because the unrest will definitely spread to Bihar and creep up to UP where Muslims are facing great difficulties to carry on many many illegal trade.
The other scenario is a bit satirist. The way Didi is implementing the blind vision on all false notes the days are really near when Ma will be cooking all delicious machher jole and kosa mangso,Mati will yield only gold and since Manush wouldn't have any thing to do but to eat, drink ( as I hear that the government will distribute daru of all sorts and there will no dry day ) and raise their knees like a canon and fart.
Now I shall advise the Bengali Babus to rise against the danger and bring saffron government to ride the wave of development and welfare of our citizens.

Why do so many people have the belief that pitbulls are bad dogs?	"Something people want to ignore, but cannot, if they are intellectually honest:
Breed traits are bred into dogs, and are VERY hard to erase. Collies, Shelties, border collies are
Golden retrievers, Labradors, these are
Some dogs are
These traits are often breed-specific. My dachshund mix ADORES digging! My old Golden retriever couldn?õ????t have cared less, but my current dog would dig to China!

"Ladies, if your man proposed to you and the ring has gemstones instead of diamonds. Would you still say ""Yes""?"	"Depends on what gemstone it is, carat weight size and quality.
If it is one of the big three gemstones (rubies, sapphires or emeralds) then definitely you should say ?õ????Yes!?õ???ù as I consider high quality ones more rare and difficult to find than a diamond.
Diamonds are marketed really well, definitely not rare and all look pretty much the same in terms of cut. But, high quality gemstones have their own charm by being unique as it is almost impossible to find multiple identical gemstone which has the same color, cut or clarity characteristics.
In fact, if you require a round brilliant, 2 carat D-color, IF-clarity diamond, with top triple excellent make (excellent cut, excellent polish & excellent symmetry) with no florescence ?õ????consider top and rarest quality white diamond?õ???ù - I can forward you 5 to 10 options immediately.
However, if you are looking for top grade, 2 carat ruby like ?õ????unheated?õ???? Burmese vivid red (pigeon?õ????s blood) or 2 carat ?õ????unheated?õ???? Kashmir vivid blue sapphire or ?õ????no oil?õ???? Colombian vivid green emerald - it would be a lot more difficult to find.

Do transgender people really care that much about what bathroom they have to use?	"I could easily answer this question with appeals to reason and appeals to emotion and anecdotal stories to explain my own personal struggles and that of friends on this topic. I?õ????ve done it on many other questions in the transgender topic. I think personal stories and humanizing stories are a great way to explain things that may seem complicated or alternatively unimportant to someone on the outside looking in.
I could try to explain to you the fear as a transwoman of some guy beating me up if I was forced to go into a men?õ????s room. How that quiet, small and often well insulated place can feel like a torture chamber or prison. I can explain the fears that I might not pass well enough when I go into a woman's room and some man will see me going in and attack me without warning assuming I am there for some nefarious purpose rather than to pee and leave.
I could go into details about every single one of those things and fill a paragraph or two about each. But in this case, I don?õ????t have to.
There is clear and objective evidence that yes, transgender people do care and that they have good cause to care. After reading it you can make up your own mind if we care and I challenge anyone who would dispute such.
Overall 59% of transgender persons avoided bathrooms altogether! Not only did they care, they were so paralyzed by the fear, controversy and very real dangers that they went without a bathroom when they needed one! Even amongst those that reported that they can pass as their gender and almost never get outed as transgender 48% sometimes avoided bathrooms. More than half of all transpeople.
A total of 18% had medical consequences from holding it! A third of us avoided eating or drinking to avoid the need for a bathroom. This is not just bathrooms we are talking about. This is why it is such a serious issue. It spills over into quality of life and safety issues.
9% of 28,000 people were denied access to a bathroom in just the last year. That?õ????s 2,520 people denied the ability to pee when they needed it.
12% of 28,000 people were verbally harassed in a bathroom in the last year. That?õ????s 3,360.
1% of 28,000 people were physically or sexually assaulted in a bathroom in the last year. That?õ????s 280 rapes and 280 assaults per year, per 28,000 people.
We are talking about thousands of medical issues like infections, thousands of verbal, physical and sexual assaults. And these are per year! Let me just say that one last time to drill this in. Thousands per year out of just 28,000 people!

What quote describes how you think?	"Technically a wonderful answer, the only answer till now, has been offered by Jim. I may not be able to write anything beyond that unless I take another route.

How is indemnity applied in marine insurances?	"Same way as in any other form of insurance.
Indemnity is the concept of making something whole after it is diminished.
If you insure your cargo, and it is lost, you will be made whole by the insurance - either reimbursed for the cargo, or have the cargo replaced in like and kind.
If you insure your boat, and you run into a smaller boat, your insurance will indemnify the owner of the smaller boat by paying for repairs, or replacing the boat.

"If all irrational numbers are an infinite string, can you assume that at some nth digit, all the digits leading up to it form a palindrome?"	"Yes, there is a position ?õ????n?õ???ù where all the digits that lead up to it form a palindrome.
That ordinal number is ONE. Let?õ????s look at ?è??:
3.141592653589793?õ????
Position 1: 3
?õ????3?õ???ù, just like ?õ????a?õ???ù and ?õ????I?õ???ù, is a palindrome.
There is also the trivial example of irrational numbers that start with 0.000000000000000000000000 before the have their first non-zero digit. I am going to ignore those possible answers. (The first 98 digits of ?è??/100 do form a palindrome.)
BUT no, for any value of ?õ????n?õ???ù greater than one, we cannot make such an assumption. There may be an occasional irrational number that has its first ?õ????n?õ???ù digits make a palindrome, but we can calculate the probability of this, and as ?õ????n?õ???ù grows larger, the probability gets smaller. In order to keep my calculations simple, I am allowing leading zeroes.
n = 1: probability = 100% (examples, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ?õ????
n = 2: probability = 10% (examples (00, 11, 22, 33, 44 ?õ????

What are some realistic ways to get rich in 5 years?	"$200k in 5 years doesn't sound ""rich"" to me, but I'll bite.?ˇ If all you want to do is get rich in 5 years, there's no need to aim high with a venture-backed business.?ˇ What you need is a simple, sales and cash-flow oriented business model.
So, drop ship some e-commerce products.?ˇ With drop shipping, your supplier ships and stores the product for you.?ˇ You don't even pay for it until you make a sale (and collect payment from your customer.
I normally recommend that people use free traffic to generate sales, just by producing valuable content around the web.?ˇ But most drop shipped products don't even need that, a simple facebook ad campaign can turn one product sales page into a money printing machine.?ˇ A machine you put quarters into and get dollars back.
How?
Well, if your gross margin (sales price minus product cost) is $70, and your facebook ads cost $.50 per click, you could sell your product to just one in ten visitors and take home $65 every single sale.?ˇ $70 gross margin minus $5 in advertising equals $65.
Sales volume would only be limited by your advertising budget.
Sounds hard, but it just takes some time and research.?ˇ The other day I spent an hour or two browsing around Etsy, evaluating some opportunities.?ˇ I will reveal one of those opportunities below: a beautiful clock I found someone drop shipping with a sale price of $65, at a cost of $10/unit to him.?ˇ He is making a KILLING.
I've mentioned in previous answers many different places you can source product: Etsy, Alibaba, AliExpress, as well as more obscure, niche wholesalers.?ˇ Etsy is a particularly great place to start for a few reasons...
When browsing through Etsy, your main objective should be to identify products where there is a wide discrepancy between what you would pay to source the product, and the value your customer will perceive in the product.?ˇ This is true for any product sourcing platform, not just Etsy.?ˇ You will heighten customer's perceived value with a brand of your own, great pictures/design, and better distribution channels (Etsy is a marketplace where price is a huge factor for customers, whereas it won't be as important to customers elsewhere).
So, anytime you see a product and think it is priced too low, that's a great sign.?ˇ Of course, there is no set profit margin for Etsy sellers.?ˇ Some will markup 10%, others 300%.?ˇ But chances are, if you think a particular seller is marking up less, they will be more likely to give you a better price and appreciate you helping them sell more product.?ˇ Other Etsy sellers, like the one selling the clock I mentioned above, are drop shipping product from places like Alibaba.?ˇ
It's not a great idea to drop ship product on someone else's platform like Etsy, Amazon, eBay.?ˇ You can make money, but not nearly as much as if you build your own infrastructure, build a brand around the product, and forgo the fees.?ˇ Etsy's audience is limited.?ˇ Plus, you can't retarget visitors with ads to remind them to come back.?ˇ A sale takes 5 exposures to the product on average, so you don't want to be counting on selling to impulsive buyers only.?ˇ People who only see the product once.
When you see a seller drop shipping on Etsy and doing well, like the clock seller, it is a great sign you will succeed independently of Etsy.?ˇ Be sure to pay attention to product reviews and favorites.?ˇ This clock's 4,380 product favorites and 2,509 five-star reviews are a great sign that it will sell like wildfire.?ˇ Reviews and favorites serve as indicators that your customers will be happy with the item they receive, and that the item itself is desirable.?ˇ
You also want to avoid listings where the quantity available is only 1, for obvious reasons.
Beautiful and elegant in style.?ˇ I would expect this clock to fetch at least $90 with its own, independent sales page.?ˇ This seller has it listed for $65 on Etsy.?ˇ It has 4,379 product favorites and the seller has 2,508 five-star reviews.
I was on Etsy looking for product I could source from the Etsy seller, then re-sell on independent sales pages.?ˇ But, the $65 price tag on this clock was suspiciously high for Etsy.?ˇ
The fact that he has had so much success selling this clock at a $55 mark-up so successfully, on Etsy, nonetheless, is a strong sign this clock would perform really well with an independent sales page.?ˇ
You could build an independent sales page for it in just an hour, using this
You would then take that sales page URL, and use it to drive traffic.?ˇ Like I said earlier, normally I recommend writing content, producing videos, etc. and publishing content around the web for free exposure.?ˇ Which is great, and free.?ˇ
But for this clock I could sell on that sales page for ~$90, I wouldn't even bother.?ˇ That's a $70 mark-up.?ˇ I would just run a variety of facebook ads, then delete the ads that didn't work. For the ads that converted, I would ramp the budget up and run them continuously.
You see, Facebook ads might cost you $.50 per click, maybe a dollar, depending on the audience.?ˇ I would put the price of the clock in the ad so it wouldn't scare any buyers off.?ˇ If each click costs me just $.50, I need to convert 1 out of every 139 visitors in to buyers to be profitable.?ˇ
Again, if just 1 in 10 visitors purchased, I would earn $75 on each sale ($90 sales price - $5 advertising cost - $10 product cost).?ˇ The sales volume would be limited only by my daily advertising budget.
These are products NOT being drop shipped by the seller.?ˇ But, you could easily just ask the seller to drop ship them for you.?ˇ See this conversation I had for example...
Margins on bath and beauty items are typically very large.?ˇ The products are cheap to produce.?ˇ It's a product category where
This Etsy seller sells this product for just $3, with 153 five-star reviews and 1,129 product favorites.?ˇ To me, that screams
A facebook ad campaign to your sales page might cost $.50 a click.?ˇ With a $12 margin, so long as you sell one every 20 clicks, you are in business.?ˇ Refine your page to sell one every ten visitors, run enough ads to sell 50 a day, and you're making $350 a day while you sleep.
Another premium, bath and beauty item.?ˇ 1,796 product favorites, 2,495 five-star reviews, and yet it's only listed for $5.?ˇ The product is already branded well, too.?ˇ I think you could probably get this product shipped to your customer for $6, but charge $17.
I can't explain why, but it seems people can't get enough of this fairy dust.?ˇ 6,235 product favorites and 196 five-star reviews.?ˇ The item is listed for $18, my guess is she will ship for a unit cost of $12.
Seems like an excellent opportunity to sell for ~$29 with some facebook ads.
Drop shipping doesn't have to be complicated, nor does picking a product to sell.?ˇ Perceived value in your customers eyes minus product sourcing costs equals your margin.?ˇ So long as you don't use your whole margin on advertising, you've got yourself a money making machine.?ˇ A machine where you put a quarter in, and it spits a dollar back out.

The girl I like asked me if I would rather go on a date with her or another girl. What do I do?	"I am not exactly sure what her agenda is, there are two scenarios i envision. First being that she is interested in you and is being a bit flirty to find out if you would go on a date with her or like her. Second being that she is asking on behalf of her friend(another girl) to gauge if you are interested in her.
In either case, my recommendation will be to indirectly ask her what is the interest of the other person. and what is her interest in this set up.
I personally never prefer to ask someone else to ask on my behalf..am not in high school anymore where this is normal. Non the less
If you find she is interested in you then you can ask her for a date to see how well you guys get along and see how things go
If you find her friend is interested, ask politely to speak to her about it, maybe you find something in common with her( girl No.2)
If you find that both are interested in you?õ????you sir are a fortunate man, in which case you shall have to find a way to date the person you like without causing a breaking of friendship between the two girls if such friendship does exist.
At all times, please be as gentleman and humble as possible
Good luck

After all of there is a G_d, or some omnipotent creating source by default all of us and everything would originate from that single source.

Jews have a very interesting and important one, which the Torah calls ?õ????light onto others?õ???ù, partners in ?õ????Tikkun Olam?õ???ù - ?õ????repair of the world?õ???ù.
Jews are supposed to teach others through their own positive example how to build unity and mutually complementing collaboration in between people above inherent differences, despite the constantly simmering ?õ????baseless hatred?õ???ù, rejecting us from one another. As we look around in our world today we can see how real and crucial this Jewish role is.

"The author?õ????s belief that they can help people by publishing their life story is the reason why publishers do not touch autobiographies written by people who are not famous. These authors mistakenly believe that just writing about what happened is attractive to readers. Tens of thousands of autobiographies prove them wrong.

"What would be the basic minimum profile that would get you into University of California, Irvine for MS in the Computer Science course?"	"See getting into UCI has been mystery to me.
I would give my personal example, I have applied twice to UCI, the first time I got a reject. My profile then :
GRE :307 GPA:3.2/4.. NO papers or conferences. Just 1 years experience. Just some good projects in undergrad
I applied to UCI the next year with 2 year experience and gre :319. I got an admit.
So in all, I think the profile as a whole and sop matters. Since their ms in cs course is heavily research oriented, I guess they would have given a complete weightage to each and every aspect of the profile. Don't go into the spike in gre scores, I agree a nominal is required to clear cutoff, as I have heard about rejects at way better gre scores than mine.
I suppose your achievements, projects, research work, interns, sop and references(no specific order) .. All will play a role here.
Best.

How does a couple get into foreplay? How do they get started?	"As with most questions about a group of people, the short answer is that it varies. Everyone does sex differently, so naturally their style of foreplay is highly individualized. Some people don?õ????t go for a lot of foreplay at all, while others make it into a whole separate activity.
My husband and I begin our foreplay in many different ways, depending on the circumstances. Sometimes one of us will roll over in bed and just start caressing the other, or we?õ????ll do the same when we?õ????re curled up on the couch together. At other times my husband might come up behind me and kiss the back of my neck while I'm typing notes or cooking dinner.
Since our house is quite large, foreplay frequently starts with a text. I might be in the living room while my husband is in the office, and I'll get a text that simple says ?õ????Blowjob??õ???ù. Or when he is feeling extra romantic: ?õ????Wanna duck??õ???ù. I know, I am the luckiest woman alive to be married to the King of Romance.
Another common way for us to get started is with discreet touching and steamy looks when we?õ????re around other people. You know how it is: You?õ????re at a restaurant with a group of people and you look across at your partner and realize that you'd like some sexy time. So you make a lot of eye contact, play a little footsie, and grab each other?õ????s butts when you finally get up. You make an excuse and hurry out to the car, where you kiss a little before you get in. Every red light is a chance to make out, and bench style seats allow you to stick your hands in each other?õ????s pants. You might even get a head start by giving your man a blowjob while he drives.
My husband and I are silly people, and a playful fight often leads to sex. It usually starts with us gently teasing each other and laughing like crazy monkeys, and then he might pick me up and tell me that he'll put me in the freezer so I'll chill, or I?õ????ll shut him up by covering his face with a pillow. Once you're laughing and in such close proximity to your partner, it is difficult
Sometimes or sex ?õ???? and foreplay ?õ???? simply starts because one of us says that it's time for sex. In those situations we just start kissing wherever we are, and then we?õ????ll either race to the bedroom (or wherever we?õ????re planning on having sex) or walk there holding hands. We almost always undress each other, but sometimes we?õ????ll each remove our own clothes for efficiency. Once we are naked, we get on the bed and start making out.

There is clear and objective evidence that yes, transgender people do care and that they have good cause to care. After reading it you can make up your own mind if we care and I challenge anyone who would dispute such.
Overall 59% of transgender persons avoided bathrooms altogether! Not only did they care, they were so paralyzed by the fear, controversy and very real dangers that they went without a bathroom when they needed one! Even amongst those that reported that they can pass as their gender and almost never get outed as transgender 48% sometimes avoided bathrooms. More than half of all transpeople.
A total of 18% had medical consequences from holding it! A third of us avoided eating or drinking to avoid the need for a bathroom. This is not just bathrooms we are talking about. This is why it is such a serious issue. It spills over into quality of life and safety issues.
9% of 28,000 people were denied access to a bathroom in just the last year. That?õ????s 2,520 people denied the ability to pee when they needed it.
12% of 28,000 people were verbally harassed in a bathroom in the last year. That?õ????s 3,360.
1% of 28,000 people were physically or sexually assaulted in a bathroom in the last year. That?õ????s 280 rapes and 280 assaults per year, per 28,000 people.
We are talking about thousands of medical issues like infections, thousands of verbal, physical and sexual assaults. And these are per year! Let me just say that one last time to drill this in. Thousands per year out of just 28,000 people!

What quote describes how you think?	"Technically a wonderful answer, the only answer till now, has been offered by Jim. I may not be able to write anything beyond that unless I take another route.

How is indemnity applied in marine insurances?	"Same way as in any other form of insurance.
Indemnity is the concept of making something whole after it is diminished.
If you insure your cargo, and it is lost, you will be made whole by the insurance - either reimbursed for the cargo, or have the cargo replaced in like and kind.
If you insure your boat, and you run into a smaller boat, your insurance will indemnify the owner of the smaller boat by paying for repairs, or replacing the boat.

"If all irrational numbers are an infinite string, can you assume that at some nth digit, all the digits leading up to it form a palindrome?"	"Yes, there is a position ?õ????n?õ???ù where all the digits that lead up to it form a palindrome.
That ordinal number is ONE. Let?õ????s look at ?è??:
3.141592653589793?õ????
Position 1: 3
?õ????3?õ???ù, just like ?õ????a?õ???ù and ?õ????I?õ???ù, is a palindrome.
There is also the trivial example of irrational numbers that start with 0.000000000000000000000000 before the have their first non-zero digit. I am going to ignore those possible answers. (The first 98 digits of ?è??/100 do form a palindrome.)
BUT no, for any value of ?õ????n?õ???ù greater than one, we cannot make such an assumption. There may be an occasional irrational number that has its first ?õ????n?õ???ù digits make a palindrome, but we can calculate the probability of this, and as ?õ????n?õ???ù grows larger, the probability gets smaller. In order to keep my calculations simple, I am allowing leading zeroes.
n = 1: probability = 100% (examples, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ?õ????
n = 2: probability = 10% (examples (00, 11, 22, 33, 44 ?õ????

n = 4: probability = 1%

What are some realistic ways to get rich in 5 years?	"$200k in 5 years doesn't sound ""rich"" to me, but I'll bite.?ˇ If all you want to do is get rich in 5 years, there's no need to aim high with a venture-backed business.?ˇ What you need is a simple, sales and cash-flow oriented business model.
So, drop ship some e-commerce products.?ˇ With drop shipping, your supplier ships and stores the product for you.?ˇ You don't even pay for it until you make a sale (and collect payment from your customer.
I normally recommend that people use free traffic to generate sales, just by producing valuable content around the web.?ˇ But most drop shipped products don't even need that, a simple facebook ad campaign can turn one product sales page into a money printing machine.?ˇ A machine you put quarters into and get dollars back.
How?
Well, if your gross margin (sales price minus product cost) is $70, and your facebook ads cost $.50 per click, you could sell your product to just one in ten visitors and take home $65 every single sale.?ˇ $70 gross margin minus $5 in advertising equals $65.
Sales volume would only be limited by your advertising budget.
Sounds hard, but it just takes some time and research.?ˇ The other day I spent an hour or two browsing around Etsy, evaluating some opportunities.?ˇ I will reveal one of those opportunities below: a beautiful clock I found someone drop shipping with a sale price of $65, at a cost of $10/unit to him.?ˇ He is making a KILLING.
I've mentioned in previous answers many different places you can source product: Etsy, Alibaba, AliExpress, as well as more obscure, niche wholesalers.?ˇ Etsy is a particularly great place to start for a few reasons...
When browsing through Etsy, your main objective should be to identify products where there is a wide discrepancy between what you would pay to source the product, and the value your customer will perceive in the product.?ˇ This is true for any product sourcing platform, not just Etsy.?ˇ You will heighten customer's perceived value with a brand of your own, great pictures/design, and better distribution channels (Etsy is a marketplace where price is a huge factor for customers, whereas it won't be as important to customers elsewhere).
So, anytime you see a product and think it is priced too low, that's a great sign.?ˇ Of course, there is no set profit margin for Etsy sellers.?ˇ Some will markup 10%, others 300%.?ˇ But chances are, if you think a particular seller is marking up less, they will be more likely to give you a better price and appreciate you helping them sell more product.?ˇ Other Etsy sellers, like the one selling the clock I mentioned above, are drop shipping product from places like Alibaba.?ˇ
It's not a great idea to drop ship product on someone else's platform like Etsy, Amazon, eBay.?ˇ You can make money, but not nearly as much as if you build your own infrastructure, build a brand around the product, and forgo the fees.?ˇ Etsy's audience is limited.?ˇ Plus, you can't retarget visitors with ads to remind them to come back.?ˇ A sale takes 5 exposures to the product on average, so you don't want to be counting on selling to impulsive buyers only.?ˇ People who only see the product once.
When you see a seller drop shipping on Etsy and doing well, like the clock seller, it is a great sign you will succeed independently of Etsy.?ˇ Be sure to pay attention to product reviews and favorites.?ˇ This clock's 4,380 product favorites and 2,509 five-star reviews are a great sign that it will sell like wildfire.?ˇ Reviews and favorites serve as indicators that your customers will be happy with the item they receive, and that the item itself is desirable.?ˇ
You also want to avoid listings where the quantity available is only 1, for obvious reasons.
Beautiful and elegant in style.?ˇ I would expect this clock to fetch at least $90 with its own, independent sales page.?ˇ This seller has it listed for $65 on Etsy.?ˇ It has 4,379 product favorites and the seller has 2,508 five-star reviews.
I was on Etsy looking for product I could source from the Etsy seller, then re-sell on independent sales pages.?ˇ But, the $65 price tag on this clock was suspiciously high for Etsy.?ˇ
The fact that he has had so much success selling this clock at a $55 mark-up so successfully, on Etsy, nonetheless, is a strong sign this clock would perform really well with an independent sales page.?ˇ
You could build an independent sales page for it in just an hour, using this
You would then take that sales page URL, and use it to drive traffic.?ˇ Like I said earlier, normally I recommend writing content, producing videos, etc. and publishing content around the web for free exposure.?ˇ Which is great, and free.?ˇ
But for this clock I could sell on that sales page for ~$90, I wouldn't even bother.?ˇ That's a $70 mark-up.?ˇ I would just run a variety of facebook ads, then delete the ads that didn't work. For the ads that converted, I would ramp the budget up and run them continuously.
You see, Facebook ads might cost you $.50 per click, maybe a dollar, depending on the audience.?ˇ I would put the price of the clock in the ad so it wouldn't scare any buyers off.?ˇ If each click costs me just $.50, I need to convert 1 out of every 139 visitors in to buyers to be profitable.?ˇ
Again, if just 1 in 10 visitors purchased, I would earn $75 on each sale ($90 sales price - $5 advertising cost - $10 product cost).?ˇ The sales volume would be limited only by my daily advertising budget.
These are products NOT being drop shipped by the seller.?ˇ But, you could easily just ask the seller to drop ship them for you.?ˇ See this conversation I had for example...
Margins on bath and beauty items are typically very large.?ˇ The products are cheap to produce.?ˇ It's a product category where
This Etsy seller sells this product for just $3, with 153 five-star reviews and 1,129 product favorites.?ˇ To me, that screams
A facebook ad campaign to your sales page might cost $.50 a click.?ˇ With a $12 margin, so long as you sell one every 20 clicks, you are in business.?ˇ Refine your page to sell one every ten visitors, run enough ads to sell 50 a day, and you're making $350 a day while you sleep.
Another premium, bath and beauty item.?ˇ 1,796 product favorites, 2,495 five-star reviews, and yet it's only listed for $5.?ˇ The product is already branded well, too.?ˇ I think you could probably get this product shipped to your customer for $6, but charge $17.
I can't explain why, but it seems people can't get enough of this fairy dust.?ˇ 6,235 product favorites and 196 five-star reviews.?ˇ The item is listed for $18, my guess is she will ship for a unit cost of $12.
Seems like an excellent opportunity to sell for ~$29 with some facebook ads.
Drop shipping doesn't have to be complicated, nor does picking a product to sell.?ˇ Perceived value in your customers eyes minus product sourcing costs equals your margin.?ˇ So long as you don't use your whole margin on advertising, you've got yourself a money making machine.?ˇ A machine where you put a quarter in, and it spits a dollar back out.

The girl I like asked me if I would rather go on a date with her or another girl. What do I do?	"I am not exactly sure what her agenda is, there are two scenarios i envision. First being that she is interested in you and is being a bit flirty to find out if you would go on a date with her or like her. Second being that she is asking on behalf of her friend(another girl) to gauge if you are interested in her.
In either case, my recommendation will be to indirectly ask her what is the interest of the other person. and what is her interest in this set up.
I personally never prefer to ask someone else to ask on my behalf..am not in high school anymore where this is normal. Non the less
If you find she is interested in you then you can ask her for a date to see how well you guys get along and see how things go
If you find her friend is interested, ask politely to speak to her about it, maybe you find something in common with her( girl No.2)
If you find that both are interested in you?õ????you sir are a fortunate man, in which case you shall have to find a way to date the person you like without causing a breaking of friendship between the two girls if such friendship does exist.
At all times, please be as gentleman and humble as possible
Good luck

After all of there is a G_d, or some omnipotent creating source by default all of us and everything would originate from that single source. And as Michael suggested each individual and nation have their own unique role, mission in the world. Jews have a very interesting and important one, which the Torah calls ?õ????light onto others?õ???ù, partners in ?õ????Tikkun Olam?õ???ù - ?õ????repair of the world?õ???ù.
Jews are supposed to teach others through their own positive example how to build unity and mutually complementing collaboration in between people above inherent differences, despite the constantly simmering ?õ????baseless hatred?õ???ù, rejecting us from one another. As we look around in our world today we can see how real and crucial this Jewish role is.

"What would be the basic minimum profile that would get you into University of California, Irvine for MS in the Computer Science course?"	"See getting into UCI has been mystery to me.
I would give my personal example, I have applied twice to UCI, the first time I got a reject. My profile then :
GRE :307 GPA:3.2/4.. NO papers or conferences. Just 1 years experience. Just some good projects in undergrad
I applied to UCI the next year with 2 year experience and gre :319. I got an admit.
So in all, I think the profile as a whole and sop matters. Since their ms in cs course is heavily research oriented, I guess they would have given a complete weightage to each and every aspect of the profile. Don't go into the spike in gre scores, I agree a nominal is required to clear cutoff, as I have heard about rejects at way better gre scores than mine.
I suppose your achievements, projects, research work, interns, sop and references(no specific order) .. All will play a role here.
Best.

How does a couple get into foreplay? How do they get started?	"As with most questions about a group of people, the short answer is that it varies. Everyone does sex differently, so naturally their style of foreplay is highly individualized. Some people don?õ????t go for a lot of foreplay at all, while others make it into a whole separate activity.
My husband and I begin our foreplay in many different ways, depending on the circumstances. Sometimes one of us will roll over in bed and just start caressing the other, or we?õ????ll do the same when we?õ????re curled up on the couch together. At other times my husband might come up behind me and kiss the back of my neck while I'm typing notes or cooking dinner.
Since our house is quite large, foreplay frequently starts with a text. I might be in the living room while my husband is in the office, and I'll get a text that simple says ?õ????Blowjob??õ???ù. Or when he is feeling extra romantic: ?õ????Wanna duck??õ???ù. I know, I am the luckiest woman alive to be married to the King of Romance.
Another common way for us to get started is with discreet touching and steamy looks when we?õ????re around other people. You know how it is: You?õ????re at a restaurant with a group of people and you look across at your partner and realize that you'd like some sexy time. So you make a lot of eye contact, play a little footsie, and grab each other?õ????s butts when you finally get up. You make an excuse and hurry out to the car, where you kiss a little before you get in. Every red light is a chance to make out, and bench style seats allow you to stick your hands in each other?õ????s pants. You might even get a head start by giving your man a blowjob while he drives.
My husband and I are silly people, and a playful fight often leads to sex. It usually starts with us gently teasing each other and laughing like crazy monkeys, and then he might pick me up and tell me that he'll put me in the freezer so I'll chill, or I?õ????ll shut him up by covering his face with a pillow. Once you're laughing and in such close proximity to your partner, it is difficult
Sometimes or sex ?õ???? and foreplay ?õ???? simply starts because one of us says that it's time for sex. In those situations we just start kissing wherever we are, and then we?õ????ll either race to the bedroom (or wherever we?õ????re planning on having sex) or walk there holding hands. We almost always undress each other, but sometimes we?õ????ll each remove our own clothes for efficiency. Once we are naked, we get on the bed and start making out.

Why doesn't a poor country print more money for itself?	"That's a real picture.
Like anything else, the value of a unit of currency is affected by supply and demand. Increasing the supply of currency by printing more of it doesn't add any new value to the economy, it just reduces the value of each unit. This is called ""inflation"". It's something that the central bank and monetary policymakers of a country have to control deliberately to maintain a stable economy. Inflation is why your grandparents could buy a new car for $800 instead of $25,000.
The scary bill in that image was the result of ""hyperinflation"". In other words, that's what happens when the authorities start printing money out of control to nominally pay debts in the short term at the expense of ruining their currency. When a currency has lost so much value that a loaf of bread is priced in millions of dollars, then everyone becomes even poorer than they were before because their wages and savings have lost value.

Is it better to go to the University of Toronto for a life sciences undergrad degree or a smaller school like the University of Ottawa for biomed?	"That question is way too vague. Nonetheless, I suggest you ask yourself a couple a questions to help narrow it down.
Better in what way? What are your circumstances? What are the costs associated with attending either? How relevant is distance from family to you? How far away from home would you be? What do you plan on doing with either degree?
There are a number of other factors that you need to keep in mind before making a decision like that.
Both schools are great and both degrees are credible. You will achieve world class education at both institutions.
So it boils down to what career you are leaning toward. If you aren?õ????t sure what you want to do after university, which is the case for so many persons, then I suggest you lean toward the higher ranked of the two.
I can?õ????t stress enough however, you need to evaluate your circumstances against both schools rather than just basing your decision on the sizes of the schools.

You don?õ????t abuse your companion. And I rather have a dog being taken care of by a homeless person, rather than being abused or euthanized at the shelter.
As a matter of fact, since homelessness is a lifestluye for some in Los Angeles, which is where I live, I keep few cans of pop-tab opening dog food in my car.

Do you think President Trump should be impeached?	"As my Criminal Law Professor used to say, ?õ????it depends.?õ???ù The question of whether or not President Trump should be impeached isn?õ????t really a legal question as much as it is a political one. Impeachment is inherently political as it is a political process conducted by a political branch of government: Legislative. And because the power to impeach rests with the House and the power to try rests with the Senate, and does so exclusively with both, there is little to no possibility of Judicial Review thanks to the Political Question Doctrine. SCOTUS articulated this best in
This is best illustrated by the case of President Clinton. Clinton lied under oath, which is perjury. Perjury is a felony and a serious crime, especially when the person committing perjury happens to be an officer of the court (Clinton was a licensed attorney and former State AG). However, the perjury pertained to the President hiding an extra marital affair, which in and of itself isn?õ????t illegal in the US (adultery is not a crime). The President and his party then successfully influenced public opinion to view the matter as a puritanical partisan attack, meaning Republicans weren?õ????t really impeaching him and trying to remove him for lying, it was for having sex. To the culture, punishment of an affair falls to the wronged spouse. So it quickly became a matter that most of the public felt was appropriately dealt with on a spousal level, not a criminal law level. Therefore President Clinton triumphed when he won the vote in the Senate (i.e. he wasn?õ????t removed). The Republican Senators who voted against removal mostly did so while stating that adultery in their eyes wasn?õ????t sufficient enough grounds (remember several Founding Fathers and Framers were themselves guilty of adultery and fathering children out of wedlock so it?õ????s likely they wouldn?õ????t have viewed the matter as grounds for impeachment).
To go back and better illustrate the inherit political nature of impeachment, we turn to the case of President Nixon. It is commonly said that Nixon resigned rather then face impeachment. This is a rather inaccurate view. Nixon originally intended to ride out impeachment much like President Clinton did. The problem was once the Watergate tapes came out publicly, too many Republican Senators came forward saying they couldn?õ????t vote against removal. As a result Nixon faced almost certain impeachment AND removal from office. So he resigned. As long as a Presidents party is willing to protect him, as in the case of President Clinton, a President may ride out impeachment and may even avoid it all together if his party controls the majority in the House. A successful impeachment also requires bipartisanship, at least for the removal part (a two thirds majority is required in the Senate which means 67 Senators). So, do I think President Trump should be impeached? At this stage I think its too early to make that call. There are still ongoing investigations and we still haven?õ????t seen all the evidence. As for whether the President actually will be impeached, that?õ????s a question of whether Trump has done something bad enough to force his political parties hand. After all, Republicans control both houses of Congress. The earliest Democrats could potentially mount an attempt would be January 2019.

What are the ethics surrounding putting a 13 year old son in a chastity device to prevent masturbation?	"What a wonderful parent you are! Most parents let their kids do whatever they want! I'm delighted to hear that you are taking control of an urgent situation like any good parent should!
JUST KIDDING.
What I want to know is, how do you know that your son is doing this? That by itself is questionable.
Also, your idea is appalling. You might as well put a gag on him so he won't eat sugar.
I understand that cultures and religions have different values and practices, but putting a chastity belt on your son is abusive and obsessive.
Putting a chastity belt on him is wrong for so many reasons. In fact, in America, it would be considered sexual harassment and incest because: a) he is most likely not going to consent. b) He is a minor. c) You are a parent.
You probably shouldn't do it. Your son will be traumatized at worst, and hate you at best. You are risking going to prison or jail as well.

We really don?õ????t know what we?õ????re doing, so it?õ????s just for entertainment.
People who win regularly on sports bets typically are professional gamblers, even if they don?õ????t call themselves that. They spend a lot of time researching their sport - usually specializing in only one sport, at least during its season.
In general, a huge percentage of people loses on sports betting.
The best way to keep a safe gambling is online. You can always try some online casinos and games that I can guarantee won't recognize you via the comfort of your personal home. :))

Is it true that there's no money in physics?	"If the question intended is ?õ????Is it easy to make money in physics??õ???ù; the qualifications should include ?õ????in comparison to what??õ???ù and ?õ????are we talking about salary or grant seeking or capital for a new venture??õ???ù
The salaries of physicists who take on quantitative finance have fascinated me. If you love the math and abstract thinking and are content to apply that talent to market behavior and valuation of investment risk/return; there apparently are open ended compensation opportunities. No longer quite open ended in banking but apparently still in hedge fund management.
Starting compensation at 120K. Up to 200K after three to four years when you make VP. Above that, it's how good you are at politics. There are people that I very strongly suspect are making >1M year.
The bonus system is dead. The regulators force the banks to move bonus to salary. That's a bad thing because in the past, you could hit the jackpot one year, and get money dumped on you. There's more of a chance for a bonus at a hedge fund.
If you prefer your physics straight:
The average yearly salary for ""quantum physicist"" ranges from approximately $68,587 per year for Researcher to $100,554 per year for Software Engineer.

A girl said we should stop dating. What am I supposed to do?	"As a woman answering this question, please take my advice:
The relationship is over. When she said she doesn't like you as a man anymore, she probably means she has lost respect for you as her romantic partner. Not as a person. I would take some time to deal with the hurt you may be feeling considering you have just been broken up with by the woman you were with.
During the time you are getting over her and dealing with the hurt, decide if you are honestly and truly able to be friends with her. If you decide you can, be just her friend and understand that as her friend she will be dating other guys and have a boyfriend eventually.
If you cannot be her friend, tell her that after you have dealt with the breakup and your emotions. Nothing is worse than speaking out of emotion and saying or doing something you truly didn't mean when you were angry or upset. People remember those things whether they forgive or not. Please understsnd that this is not the end of the world although it may feel like it. I hope I helped and that you feel better.

I am seeking an early release from the company which has a 3 months notice period (I want to get relieved in a month and ready to buy out the remaining notice period). HR is not agreeing with it. What can I do in this situation?	"First let me tell you my experience as many years ago I have been in same situation. I had two months notice period. I removed dependency on me in a month's time. Still one of the senior manager & HR guys were making it ego issue. I reasoned with them why they want to pay me for one month for just sitting idle. They didn't listen. I talked with my new employer. They were okay to extend the joining date but mentioned that I would be loosing a crucial training period.
Deeply frustrated, I talked to my brother who had a close friend in his company's HR. I sent me a scanned copy newspaper cutting of a court case wherein an employee was denied experience letter because of not serving full notice period. Employer was treating it as absconding case. However, the court verdict was in favour of employee and court said, no employment contract can be one sided. If the employee was willing to pay the money, employer had no right to force him to stay. Court also scolded employer for the same.
Next day, I took a print of that cutting and went to manager's cabin. I put that on his table and told him clearly that his understanding of employment contract is flawed. If he still don't understand, I will stop coming office from next day and will have a legal notice served for harassment and unethical employment practice. Next day, I got e-mail confirming acceptance of my resignation and confirmation of release date. I got experience letter and full & final settlement. They deducted some salary for remaining notice period. But that was okay with me as new employer was willing to pay for that.
That was my story. Now coming to your story. The typical contract is - either party has to provide 'X' months notice or salary in liu. It works on both ways. Employer can choose to throw you out any day but then they will have to pay you 'X' months of salary. If you want to leave the company any day, you can just pay the salary as per notice period and leave. Legally they can't stop you.
Generally speaking we should always leave the company amicably because it's a small industry and who knows your path cross with the same reporting manager again. However, in your case its whims of HR person. Are you sure your reporting manager is not playing double game i.e. telling you that he is okay to release but on the back asking HR to stop you. So, what you could do is:
I am confident that they will understand the gravity of situation and you will get your release.
What I have mentioned above is little extreme measure. So, before you do that, you can try other things such as talk to HR of your new employer and tell them the situation. If they are reasonable guys, they will guide you. Many times, new employer just agree to extend joining date.

What do you think about non-binary genders?	"Non-binary genders exist, people who experience gender in a non-binary way are very real and all too often, non-binary genders aren?õ????t taken seriously which is tragic. It?õ????s even more tragic when their identities aren?õ????t validated by people within the trans community because we of all people should know better.
The thing I get asked to opine about most frequently with regard to non-binary genders is the proliferation of pronouns. I tend to think that language is in a seeking phase. I think, as time moves on, we?õ????ll see more consensus emerge about a smaller set of non-binary pronouns rather than exponential growth of pronouns?õ???? but right now, language is struggling to keep up with Internet speed social advancement so?õ???? we have more pronouns at the moment than I think we?õ????ll wind up with. That said, it costs me literally nothing to respect a person?õ????s pronouns, whether those pronouns are They/Them/Theirs, Xe/Xir/Xirs or anything else and I see no reason for anyone to not respect another person?õ????s pronouns.
Other than that.. gender is complicated and so is the way we experience it. Everything I think about non-binary genders would take at least a chapter in a book, likely starting from here:
The important thing is that non-binary identities should be validated and respected. Doing so costs us little to nothing but means a great deal to the people we encounter who fall outside a socially constructed binary view of gender.

Is it a bad idea to not intern during junior summer if you have interned in previous summers and semesters?	"The biggest thing that consulting firms like McKinsey are looking for when it comes to hiring interns and full time employees is experience. Why?
If your potential employer in the future asks you why you didn't intern the previous summer, I recommend you have a good answer. Working on projects alone and studying for the GMAT is an okay answer. This is only an okay answer, because as a consultant they are expecting you to lead them to a solution, and not necessarily do the work for them on your own (although that might be the case).

How do I find what I really want to do in my life?	"Let me start from your last question in comment section: Why do you need to escape from your ?õ????depression?õ????? Simply because it tires you out everyday.
I am myself a dreamer, like you, I want a happy life, with stable job, good enough salary, good education, excel nicely in everything I do, to have everlasting and caring friends, warm family, and the list go on. When I dream of those things, it would make me happy if I could achieve it someday. Then normally, I would make plan on how to achieve those. I set my aspirations, targets, goals, wishes, and compare it with what I have now and what I should have (skills, connections, etc.). I make my paths to make my imagination happens. Then, do you know what?õ????s the hardest part? Although finishing the plan is hard, but by actually doing it is harder.
For me, before actually doing it, I have imagined worst cases that would happen when I do it. I became scared, pretty much chicken out. I could see that I would encounter many obstacles that could bring me down, sometimes it feels like it?õ????s not tolerable, it seems like waaaaay too hard. It just feel like your life crumbling little by little.
But you know, I?õ????m trying to accept the reality that it is how life works.
Sometimes you go high and sometimes you go low. You just have to live in it and enjoy every moment that happens. Have courage to actually start doing it because you actually have the chance to do something. There are other people who are struggling to even breathe normally, but some of them fight anyway. Please have courage to fight for your life. I know sparking a spirit to live when your life seems like an ultimate disaster is hard, but you?õ????ll never know what will happen next if you do not start doing it. I learned this when I know that I am just another ordinary person who might lose all the harsh competition this life offers. But I believe when I try to improve myself, by doing something for me and others, I will finally live my life.
We are just some lucky bastards that happen to live on earth and let?õ????s make sure we enjoy every second passed by.
Also, about how do you find about what you want to do in life by simply trying things out! Just like tasting new food. It might be something similar to what you have tasted but there are food that is just sooooo different from what you have tasted. You might like the new flavor but sometimes you don?õ????t and it is okay! So yeah, keep on trying living your life. For now, you know that you only have one life so cheerish it well. You can do it!

"When a star fuses into iron, why is that the start of its death?"	"Disclaimer:I am not expert in this subject and as such I state this answer only on my understanding of physics.
Fusion works on principle that
So when atom fuses it gives a lot of energy. If the atoms are light in terms of mass, Energy required to fuse is
This net positive energy is used to fuse further more atoms and thus creates chain reaction.
Hydrogen fusion to helium is the most efficient fusion reaction.
Now what you state here is called silicon burning process of a star.
Long story short, when star starts fusing iron(Fe), it pretty much end of its life.
Iron fuses with Helium to convert to Nickel.
Now here the Energy required to fuse is
So instead of chain reaction, this prevents other atoms fusion.
Further Nickel fuses with Helium to Zinc which also reduces overall available energy.
In other words star will run out of both fuel and energy to induce fusion and thus based on size, it shall be death of star into supernova and neutron star or black hole.

If	"I?õ????ve enjoyed many of the answers here, but most of them require far too many steps, in my opinion. While valid, and illuminating they are inefficient. I think that with strong number sense one could come to the conclusion that the values of both x and y are 1 and that therefore xy is also equal to 1.
The first intuitive leap is realizing that x = 1, y=1, is a solution to both equations. Starting with x+ y = 2, an infinite number of value pairs could satisfy this equation, but 1+1 is probably the first pair of addends that we all learn to get a sum of 2. Only mental math is required to test this against the second equation and realize (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. So if x = 1, y = 1, then xy =(1)(1) = 1. Great problem solved in about 2 seconds of mental math.
The missing ingredient however is to conclude if this is just one solution of many, or if there are other possible solutions. This step is significantly harder to do intuitively and mentally, but I think strong number sense can still get us there, likely without writing down a single step. Everything I lay out below is therefore not something I am writing out, but just reasoning through in my head and then trying to explain on paper. As such the explanation below is significantly more complex than other solutions, because number sense is more lengthy to explain than to use. Anyone who can suggest ways of making this simpler, clearer, and shorter, while still using only mental reasoning and number sense, please make suggestions in the comments.
One helpful thing to realize is that this system of equations has a maximum of two solutions so there is at most one additional value for xy. (If you are wondering why there are a maximum of two potential solutions, check out Vaibhav Soni?õ????s graphical solution:
To test other solutions mentally, start with pairs of addends that can give a sum of 2.
(-3)(-3) + (5)(5) = 9+25 = 34 (e.g. way bigger than 2).
To make sure we?õ????ve eliminated this possibility, it?õ????s important to understand that it doesn?õ????t matter what positive-negative pair we pick; all of them will yield a sum larger than 2. This is because the positive number will need a magnitude exactly 2 higher than the negative number to yield a sum of 2 (e.g. -1 +3, -2+4, -3+5, -4+6 etc.). This means that the positive number squared will yield a number larger than 2 squared i.e. larger than 4, while the negative number squared will yield another positive number as well, meaning that the sum of them will always be larger than 4. (If this reasoning is confusing try several such pairs in your head and see if you can understand why it is always true.) Since all pairs in this category yield a sum larger than 4 in the second equation, none of these can equal 2 in that equation, and no solutions in this category will work for both equations.
(3/4)(3/4) = (3*3)/(4*4) = 9/16. OR (5/2)(5/2) = (5*5)/(2*2) = 25/4.
So this means that any fractional pair when plugged into the second equation will yield a sum of two fractions. At this point intuitively it seems unlikely that we are going to get a sum of 2 from the sum of two fractions squared. But how can we determine if that intuition is accurate?
Taking a couple examples might give us a little insight. The pair 1/4 +7/4 satisfies the first equation (1/4 +7/4 = 8/4 = 2). When tested in the second equation we get:
(1/4)(1/4)+(7/4)(7/4) = 1/16 + 49/16 = 50/16 (or 3 and 1/8 if you prefer).
My spidey sense is tingling, telling me that a fraction pair is not going to add up to a nice even 2 when tested in the second equation, but of course that?õ????s not mathematically good enough.
This next part is going to get a little ugly, and if anyone who finds this way of thinking interesting has a better way of
For a sum of two fractions to equal 2 (e.g. satisfy the first equation), then the sum of their numerators must be equal to double their shared denominator. For example in the case of 1/4 + 7/4 = 8/4, 1+7 (the sum of the numerators) is equal to 8, which is double 4 (the original numerator).
For the second equation to also be true however, the
The part I?õ????m having trouble putting into words is that this shifting nature of the proportional relationship of the numerators makes it impossible that they will add to make double the denominator both in the first equation and the second. Again if someone else can find a way of explaining why this is necessarily so (or alternatively disprove my claim and demonstrate that it is actually not necessarily true), I?õ????d love to hear it. At this point I can only say, that it seems clear that two numbers cannot add to equal 2 and also have their squares add to equal 2 unless those numbers are both one, and that the reason is this changing relationship of numerators to sum.

I have been using their amazing service for a while, it?õ????s the best investment I have ever made to my Instagram account. You should give them a try, they are providing very good and high quality service.
No matter what industry your business is in, you have a story to tell that is perfectly suited for a highly visual social network like Instagram. A compelling narrative in your content will give it a sense of purpose and can inspire word-of-mouth from your current community, making your Instagram account more attractive to new followers.
Satisfy curiosity by showing followers how your product is made, share the perspective of an employee to humanize your brand, or position your brand in an aspirational way by showcasing the lifestyle or achievements of your customers. You don?õ????t have to limit your Instagram strategy to only one of these groups. Most successful brands will tell all of these stories at once in different ways and perhaps across different social channels.
This may seem like a no-brainer but it can?õ????t be stressed enough: the better your Instagram content is, the more likely you are to get more Instagram followers. Posting photos that are blurry, branded inconsistently, or simply not interesting provides no incentive for people to follow you. Here are some guidelines for improving your Instagram content strategy.
Running contests on Instagram can help further grow your audience, drive traffic to your website, and even help you sell product. To enter the contest, ask people to either follow you, like, comment on one of your photos, use a specific hashtag, or repost one of your photos. Encouraging user-generated content as part of your contest will help you reach more people. Those who don?õ????t follow you already will be exposed to your Instagram account through a post created by one of their friends, which is an effective way of building trust with new followers.
Benefit Cosmetics has successfully used Instagram contests to tie together the online and offline experience of their customers. For a recent campaign, they partnered with beauty retailer Ulta to run an Instagram contest that encouraged users to share a selfie after a visit with a brow expert at a local Ulta store. By following the @BenefitCosmetics account and posting their selfie using the hashtag #browbestie, the customer would be entered to win a year?õ????s worth of brow service as well as $250 in Benefit products.
This contest achieved three things: it acted as an incentive for new followers, it showcased and promoted the in-store experience, and it rewarded the community for an online behavior that came naturally to them.
Incorporating Instagram into your overall marketing campaigns can help you gain new followers and connect the offline and online experience for your customers. For example:
Taco Bell announced they were going to begin serving breakfast in a quick Instagram video that was fun to watch, showed the product, and got their audience excited.

Why are evolutionists striving to save species from extinction when it's part of the evolutionary theory for every species to eventually go extinct/change?	"Our planet is experiencing a period of mass extinction, where the background extinction rate is much higher than the normal rate of between 1 and 5 species a year. That rate of extinction is natural, and sustainable. Currently, we are losing up to a dozen species a day or more. Scientists differ in their estimates of exactly how many species we are losing, but they agree that the current background rate is considerably higher than the historic one.
Earth has experienced mass extinctions before. All of them were caused by natural phenomena. Things like asteroid strikes, natural shifts in the earth?õ????s climate and widespread volcanic eruptions have changed the environment enough to eliminate hundreds or thousands of species in a very short time. But the current mass extinction even is almost entirely due to human activities. Humans introduce non-native species, like rabbits or cats or goats into a new area and they compete with the native species, often hunting them to extinction or eating the food they rely on for survival. Humans devastate habitats by doing things like clear-cutting forests, and they produce pollutants that drive climate change, which also changes habitats so species that once thrived can no longer survive. Just one example. The Arctic ice cap is shrinking at alarming rates, Climate changes driven by this loss of sea ice can be felt as far away as the Indian Ocean. Global warming, much as conservatives want to pretend it doesn?õ????t exist, is having drastic effects on the environment.
The good news is that since humans are responsible for much of this change, humans working together can mitigate some, but not all, of the losses. We will never be able to reverse the changes we have wrought in the environment, but we may, by adapting new technologies, passing laws to protect habitats, and learning to cherish the enormous variety of species that make up our ecosystem, stabilize the rate of extinction and preserve our plant?õ????s future.

To which race do Pakistanis belong?	"Pakistan is a multi-ethnic and multi-racial county. It has literally hundreds of ethnicities or races. Many people make the mistake of thinking that linguistic identities of Pakistanis are also a racial identities. Even many Pakistanis are guilty of the same make.
We have to remember that Pakistan and its neighbors on both, east and west, sides have been invaded hundreds of times for past 5000 years by people of many different ethnic backgrounds, many of whom chose to stay here permanently. Even though some races have become quite homogeneous with some other races because of intermarriages, however, many other races can easily be recognized as non-native in the purest sense.
Many Sindhis can easily be identified as Dravidians, believed to be the true natives of South Asia. Many Punjabis of southern Punjab are of Baluch origin. Many Baluchis are of Persian origin. Many Pathans claim to be of Middle Eastern, Palestinian or Jewish origin. Yet, many other Pathans have very European features. Kelash people of northern Pakistan are probably of Greek origin. Many of them still have natural blond hair. Some people in Pakistan trace back their origins to Prophet Muhammad or his companions, hence, Middle East or present day Saudi Arabia. Many dark skinned people in Baluchistan trace their background to Africa and there is historical evidence to support such claims.
As you can see Pakistanis are truly multi-ethnic, multi-racial and multi-cultural people. Economic and political divisions in Pakistan are stronger than ethnic ones.

Unfortunately, our president has consistently behaved in a manner that led me to never take his words at face value. Everybody should fact check.

I need $5000 by the end of 4 months. How do I do it?	"Well its all about the mindset and the willingness to put in the required work. 4 months are a considerable time period to make that much money or more. You can do a job, but some jobs would not pay much and if you are in a less developed country, it would take more time to make that much amount.
I would suggest you to sell something. Certainly there are a lot of opportunities in e-commerce these days. Just try to buy something cheap from thrift stores etc and sell it on e-bay or any other online platform. You could even sell small items on streets. If you make good sales, you can make that much amount easily.
However if you have spare time, you can still make money with paid surveys. I believe that they would also help making some money on the side. I will recommend you to use Survey Junkie for making money in part-time. But have your focus on selling.

Are you a cat lover or dog lover? Why?	"I prefer cats, but that might have a lot to do with the particular cat I have.
My cat, Rupert, is indoor-outdoor, and learned very quickly to ?õ????knock?õ???ù when he wants to go in or out. He also doesn't use a litter box, and just knocks to be let out when he has to go. I'd probably be less of a cat fan if I had to empty a litter box all the time. My friends with dogs let them out or walk them regularly to do their business, but I still hear about them finding dog poop on the floor on a pretty regular basis.
I have never had a flea issue with Rupert. Maybe they just don't find him delicious? I check him for fleas often and never find any. All my friends with dogs have to buy pricey flea treatments on a regular basis.
My dog owner friends are always very amazed when they visit, because there isn't cat hair on everything, and I have a long haired cat. I'm always amazed when I visit them, because my clothes always get covered in dog hair.
My cat likes to chill with me, and sleeps on my feet almost every night, but I can also ignore him when I'm busy and he doesn't mind. He goes off and does whatever.
My dog owning friends have to be sure they don't let too much time pass before they go home and let their dogs out, whereas my cat is always fine when I get back.
I don't have to make sure to feed Rupert. I make sure his food tub has food in it, dumping in an entire bag at a time, and he eats when he gets hungry.
Rupert bathes without my help, dog owners have to wash their dogs.
He catches rodents that wish to destroy my garden, dogs often dig up gardens.
He is quiet (my neighbors have never complained about him barking too loud).
Unlike the dogs I know, he never begs to eat my food.
He loves car trips, walks on a leash, and greets me excitedly when I get home.
I think he has all the positive qualities of a dog, but none of the negative attributes of a dog.
I definitely prefer cats, but I also realize my cat is not normal.

Would you take your PC to the computer repair shop?	"I would be very, very careful about taking a computer to a random computer shop. I am able to fix most problems with my computers, fortunately.

"How can a software developer/engineer embedded in marketing at an SaaS company help the team (events, content marketing, social, and lead generation)?"	"I am a stickler for structure. Everything I do work wise has to be as structured (and automated) as possible. This way, my whole team - new and veteran - know exactly what is going on, as well as executive management who are able to predict growth.
So, don't do things willy-nilly.
Sit and make a plan. You could throw money at an inbound marketing campaign i.e SEO, PPC etc. At this stage though I think it would be best to run an outbound sales campaign.
I strongly recommend you search about Facebook Ads / Facebook Dark Post and your real power.
Read this Step-by-Step:
When creating a Facebook ad, most advertisers use the default process that looks like this?õ????
This is an inline page post ad where the advertiser creates the ad on the fly. In this case, it?õ????s being done with a carousel of multiple image links, but you could also select ?õ????Ad with an image or video?õ???ù to create an ad with one link.
This approach is just fine, and it?õ????s preferred in some cases. The nice thing about the inline page post ad is that it can be edited or easily duplicated and altered to create variations.
But there?õ????s one big issue: If you want to use the same ad in multiple ad sets, you can?õ????t use an inline page post ad.
Sure, you could replicate it. It would look the same as the original. But each ad you run will have its own comments, likes, shares and other engagement. In many cases, you want to leverage the great engagement you?õ????re getting on one ad across other ad sets and campaigns.
From the Ads Manager navigation, click ?õ????Page Posts?õ???ù from the ?õ????Create & Manage?õ???ù column.
At the far right, click the blue ?õ????Create Post?õ???ù button.
You?õ????ll get a dialog that looks like this?õ????
This message at the top is interesting:
If you use unpublished Page posts to create ads, you no longer need to. You can now create News Feed eligible ads in the Ads tab of Power Editor.
Yeah, it?õ????s true. You don?õ????t need to create ads this old way anymore. But there are certainly advantages to it, as mentioned above.
As you can see in the image above, you can create the following post types:
I?õ????m not going to go through the details of each. If you know how to create an ad, you know how to create an unpublished page post. But here?õ????s an example for a link?õ????
In this case, I chose not to provide a link headline, display link, description or image. If you don?õ????t provide it, Facebook will attempt to pull it from your website?õ????s metadata. But you can always choose to override it?õ????. (
With outbound sales, you primarily have two choices:
1) Cold email
2) Cold call
I?õ????m a hater when it comes to cold calling. I have done it, managed teams that do it, and even though it does work, it is not an enjoyable process for anyone involved. When managing cold call teams, our staff moral was low and staff turnover was massive; so for every $, ???ú and ?õ???™ we were making, we were having to throw back into recruitment! Not a great way to grow at all.
So lets assume you're going to begin a structured outbound cold email campaign. Some fundamental activities/tools you'll need (I recommend):
1) Ideal Customer Profile - you will have to drill down on exactly who is most likely to buy your product. I split our ICP's to geo-demographics, industry, company size and job title.
2) Email addresses - you need the professional email addresses of your ICP's. For this I highly recommend
3) CRM - You need to manage your leads, right? Check out
4) Outreach - You'll need a tool that will allow you to create drip feed campaigns / email automation. When doing cold emailing, do not give up after 1 or 2 emails! We use
Whichever process you choose, just make sure there is structure and persistence around the whole process. And do not give up!

"What is more difficult to be? A doctor or an IITian ? I?ˇ am a medical student and I see a lot of hype given to IIT-ians, which I simply don't get. Why is it so ?"	"I qualified for both.
I had a rank in the 1100s in the IITJEE, got into Roorkee Engineering College and BIT, Ranchi (they all had their own exams then).
The engineering entrance exam results used to come before the medical entrance exams so I was already done with the counseling for the IITs (I got Electronics in IT BHU) and had bought my train ticket for Varanasi when the medical entrance exam results began to come.
I had always wanted to be a doctor and the IIT entrance exams were a sort of afterthought, an insurance policy in case I couldn't get into medical college.
Once I got into MAMC, there was never any doubt about which to drop and I've had no regrets. I've kept in touch with friends who have gone to IIT. They had to work hard too to get good grades, to be among those who got on-campus interviews.
Many of them moved out of engineering after they finished their B Tech. They did an MBA and moved into selling cars or became bankers. One of them took the civil services exam and became a bureaucrat. I thought it strange that they worked so hard to get into IIT, worked hard to get good grades and then wasted it all.
I did not know anyone of that minority who went on to become innovators in engineering. Meanwhile, I went through the process of getting through medical college (not as difficult as most people think, I was neither among those struggling to pass nor among those striving to top). I enjoyed it.
I wanted to be a surgeon and started my surgical residency (after another round of entrance exams) around the time that my IIT friends were finishing their MBAs and getting their first jobs.
They were earning a lot more than me and I was working 120 hours a week but it was mostly fun, never felt like a mistake and I never regretted it.
3 years of surgery residency were followed by 2 years of senior residency, 3 years of fellowship in Gastrointestinal Surgery (after another entrance exam with only one seat to compete for), 2 years of research in a lab, 3 years of transplant fellowship (for which I had to pass the US Medical Licencing Exams), followed finally by my first real job at the age of 38 (back home in India).
Of course, I was paid during my training. Enough to get along with but not really enough to save anything.
Some of them lost their jobs during the economic meltdown but they mostly have jobs again. Most of them have reached close to as high as they will in their profession.
The competition is often unfair and unethical and many of them say they would not make the same decision again and they do not want their children to become doctors.
Many went to the US after their MBBS to escape this rat race and have a comfortable life there.
My kids have already decided that medicine is not for them and I agree. I myself have no regrets and would make the same decisions if I had to go through it again but I think I would have enjoyed myself as an engineer too.
I don't think I would have taken the MBA route though.

"Do you think someone is a sexist if he (they) prefers ""God created man"" to ""God created people""? What should we use in Christian spiritual writings?"	"The bible is written for the most part in masculine terms but it gives honor to the feminine sex. It does not subjugate, demean, or speak down to women.
Today it is not popular to give undue attention to the male gender but there is nothing wrong with stating that ?õ????God created man.?õ???ù The bible uses that term and if it is good enough for God then it is good enough for a Christian to use when writing.
In the very next verse the bible speaks of the creation of both the man and the woman.
What does it mean that God created man in his image? Since we are physical beings he obviously did not mean we look alike. So the bible must be talking about personality traits. God has four dominate qualities to his personality. Those qualities are love, power, wisdom and justice.
This quality of God is his most dominate quality. Notice that ?õ????God is love.?õ???ù Love encompasses his entire being. Since we are created in his image we have that quality too. Christians should allow love to motivate all they do. Now take a look at two more of his qualities:
The qualities of power and wisdom were passed on to man when God created man in his image.
The fourth quality that God possesses, that he passed on to man when he created man in his image, is justice. He expects Christians to exercise justice in their dealings with others.
There are examples of women in the bible that God used to accomplish his purpose just as he used many men. Mary actually became the mother of Jesus Christ, the son of God. What greater honor could possibly be bestowed on any woman. Women are treated with love, honor, dignity and respect in the bible and a true Christian will treat them in a like manner.

"Why do huskies look so funny, stupid and hilarious?"	"Huskies are extremely smart dogs with very distinct markings (some Huskies - some are all white or other colors). Those ?õ????masks?õ???ù on their face give them the appearance of emotions and human-like expressions.
But I?õ????ve always joked that Huskies are part wolf (very strong prey instinct), part cat (a very independent streak), and part human (they don?õ????t understand why they shouldn?õ????t sit on the chair and sleep in the bed).

"I didn't do my public speaking well due to errors, what can I do?"	"Give yourself a bit of a break. No one does a new skill perfectly the first few times. The point of your class is to develop a foundation that you will build on for years. Give yourself permission to not be great at this for a while. :)
You were probably nervous, and you skipped a section of your speech. My recommendation would be to focus on two things: breathing/slowing down, and prep.
Breathing and slowing down are pushing toward the same goal. You need to calm yourself a bit (a lot). When you get nervous/anxious we tense up, and speed up and our ability to react dynamically to the situation is lost. Focusing on your breathing will help with that.
Take deep, even breaths. Like if you were doing a meditation exercise. (There are thousands of videos on youtube that will give you guidance on breath technique if you need it.) If you get flustered, stop. Take a breath or two. Let your thoughts settle a little, and pick up where you left off.
If you continue to get lost in your speech, you probably need to spend a bit more time on your preparation. Read through the speech several times. Make sure you feel comfortable with the flow of it. That practice will give you something to fall back on if you get flustered.

Can you go one week with no smart phones?	"I went 6 weeks without a smartphone.
Not by choice mind you. My phone had an accident involving itself, a pair of board shorts and the beach. Suicide by ocean.
Leaving my phone to it?õ????s watery grave, I had to decide between getting a replacement or waiting 6 weeks for the release of the Nexus 5x. Going 6 weeks without a phone is quite a while for me.
For a bit of context, I?õ????m a product manager working for an ecommerce website . . . so having a smartphone for testing features and optimising for mobile is damn important.
But I was also curious. How dependent had I become on my smartphone? So I decide to go smartphoneless for a while and see if I could cope. So I let everyone know via Facebook and prepared myself for digital exile.
It is weird going from using a smartphone everyday to suddenly disconnecting from everything. No notifications, no little buzzes to let you know someones thinking of you. Nothing to distract you while you were bored or when you?õ????ve got that weird thought that you have to confirm by Googling on the spot.
When you have no phone it makes you notice things. It makes you notice how absorbed everyone else is on their phones. For both good things and bad things. That guy who just received an essay length message from someone on FB messenger and you know he?õ????s in trouble. That girl mindlessly going through her phone, swiping through apps, closing them, then going through contacts then switching off her phone then opening it again. That one guy fitting in one more episode of Gotham before he heads into work (guilty of).
The silence can be oddly zen. Going to work knowing that no one will message you. Going about your work day with the minimum of distractions except annoying Annie in sales. The absence of dank memes entering my life.
All in all I got so used to it that when I purchased my brand new Nexus 5x it felt overwhelming. Suddenly I had over 1000+ Whatsapp, emails, Facebook messenger and Snaps to catch up on.
So you know what I did? I just clicked ?õ????Marked as Read?õ???ù and went on about my day. Disconnecting was a great experience and I believe healthy for people to incorporate into their schedule.

People should be more concerned about the news and media in the US who are feeding you info that has been fed to them by various government intelligence agencies.

Contrary to popular belief, most of the news you see on TV and read in the papers are propaganda designed to serve a government agency or political party?õ????s agenda.

"If a president were to be impeached, found guilty and was ordered to serve a prison sentence, where would he/she likely serve time in prison?"	"If a president or any other impeachable officer in the U.S. federal government is convicted by the Senate after being impeached by the House, that person is removed from office. The impeachment conviction is not for a criminal offense. The Senate cannot and does not impose any judgment other than removal from office. They are not part of the criminal court system and have no power to send a person to jail.
Criminal charges are brought by a prosecutor who is an officer of the court and the court and usually a jury adjudicates the charges and determines whether a prison sentence is appropriate. The rules for criminal charges and the process are entirely different and separate from a Congressional impeachment.

"When the left says that everyone should pay their fair share in taxes, what is the fair share for everyone?"	"A taxpayer?õ????s ?õ????fair share?õ???ù is whatever percentage the particular leftist anwering the question thinks it should be. Don't ever expect to get a number because that would limit potential power available in the future. It is not just self-identified progressives who refuse to give numbers. Progressive Republicans play this game too. In a presidential campaign appearance/debate, Mitt Romney once refused to answer a question about what maximum tax rate an American should be rightly expected to pay. Instead, you will hear about unfair loopholes and advantages, and that the rich get more from the system and so should pay more into it.
A flat tax would fully address those complaints by forcing all taxpayers to pay the same percentage of income earned, but the left will never accept one because those arguments are insincere. An individual progressive might not even know how insincere those statements are. But the truth is, the left wants a ?õ????progressive?õ???ù tax system precisely because it is unfair. Higher rates on the rich just feel right, and it provides the left the the opportunity to take what they think of as ill-gotten wealth from the rich and give it to the poor. Never underestimate the appeal to a progressive of playing Robin Hood.
The thing is, Robin Hood is the story of a man who stole from the corrupt church/government and gave to the people whom that corruption had impoverished. It's not the story of a man who stole from hard-working, successful merchants and gave to cronies who would then vote for him. Progressives don't see a difference because they don't believe there is a difference, nor that creativity and hard work breed success. After all, ?õ????you didn't build that,?õ???ù so it's only fair to take a disproportionate amount of it from you and hand it over to the people you must have stepped on to get it. They are happy to worry about exact policy details only when it suits them to do so.

Why doesn't my 18-year-old daughter understand math? What is wrong with her?	"One thing that is wrong with her, is that neither her parent nor her tutor treat her very well when it comes to math.
I can't comprehend why anyone would think that another person can learn math, by yelling at them? Do you think that she'll suddenly understand it after being hurt and degraded?
Stop being angry. Accept what your child can and can't.
And then find her a tutor who are better at explaining math to people with math troubles. She might have dyscalcula (like dyslexia but with numbers) or she might have a need to look at it more graphically or look at it like music. Math can easily be turned into shapes, colors and sounds, if the math tutor know anything about teaching and mathematics.

Should I get married on a salary of 20k in Kolkata?	"You have asked this question for two reasons, but the emotion behind it remains the same which is confusion. And confusion prevails where there are expectations. This was one thing.
Secondly, those two things being the most common fallacy of today's youth - money and marriage. It's not a thing ive heard for the first time. It remains the same fallacy with different questions. Your basic eligibility criteria in marriage remains money. Till you are looking for marriage based on goals and desires to fulfill, this confusion will ever remain.
Marriage is a union of two individuals whilst forming a new family or new community for that matter. This is from where the concept of communes start along, when people have forgotten than Indian society already understood it millenniums back calling it a joint family system. In that system money did not matter, coz the couple was taken care by the commune even their kids were raised by the elders of the commune. This was a beautiful concept of having marriages, that is one reason even early age marriages were so successful and beautiful then, which people at a maturity of 30 also fail to create these days.
Try getting into marriage with a sense of love, care and sensitivity rather than for money, sex or norms of societal status. You will be happy with whatever you earn and whichever city you live.

Is math about formulas or explaining? My teacher says I shouldn't memorize formulas. Is it wrong?	"Maths is
As I have a mathematical sort of brain, I did find it easier on the whole to work out a formula from first principles (eg the formula for the roots of a quadratic equation) rather than memorising it. That was a sort of laziness on my part.
If you want to pass exams, memorising formulae is a pretty good idea. If you want to be a mathematician, then understanding them is far, far more important.

There are YouTube channels that show the unboxing of the latest releases in mobiles and devices. How did they primarily start that business?	"Everyone starts from scratch! Ofcourse they couldn't unbox the stuff they do now when they started. They usually start off with small things that they buy for themselves as necessities, and upload them on YouTube. As time passes by and they start gaining audience and attention, they start receiving in offers and sponsorships from brands and companies to unbox their products, which in turn is a promotion for the brand.( this is easily setup if you are in a YouTube network). Once they're big enough, more and more companies reach out to them, and that's when you see the cool and expensive stuff being unboxed.
Now ofcourse not everyone starts of the same way. Some are rich enough to afford breaking a few iPhones, such as Techrax( who is known to be pretty rich).
In conclusion, you have to grind in order to reach that level, but ofcourse it's worth it ( I mean I would love to unbox cool stuff like unbox therapy).
Thank you and have a nice day.

"Is there a religion that worships ""The One True God""? If so, what is it?"	"All Abrahamic religions claim the same thing. In fact they all have many things in common indicating that they originated from the same source. Since belief in God is a matter of rational argumentation, you cannot just follow what others say (without any difference if these others are your parents, friends, the society in which you live, etc.), rather you have to follow what your reason leads to. Needless to say you have to listen to different claims and compare them with each other on the basis of agreement with rational reasoning. As far as I have studied, Islam (particularly Shiism) attaches high importance to rationality and rebukes those who just imitate others when it comes to beliefs. If you just read the Quran, time and again you would come across verses inviting people to use their faculty of reason, praising those who do so, or rebuking those who do not follow sound reason; take these for example:
There are also numerous traditions in this regard.
What some of the adherents of a religion do on the ground may be contrary to the teachings of the religion itself. Therefore you have to study a religion itself from its original sources and not take the practice of some followers as your premise to pass judgement.

What is the process of calculating	"A square root is the ?õ????inverse operation?õ???ù for squared, because they ?õ????undo?õ???ù each other. Squared means a value multiplied with itself. 3^2=3*3=9 Therefore, sqrt(9) is asking the question ?õ????What number, multiplied with itself, would give 9??õ???ù Memorizing common squares is very helpful.
When the given number is NOT a perfect square, you can still estimate square-roots to 1 decimal place pretty consistently.
Ex: Determine sqrt(70)
Step 1 - Know all of the perfect squares up to 20^2
Step 2 - Identify the two perfect squares the given number is between.
Step 3 - Estimate ?õ????where?õ???ù it is, between the two (really close to 8, really close to 9, or kind of in-between)
Step 4- Check your estimate
Step 4b - Repeat Step 4, trying to get closer.
If your estimate was far off, you can pick another trial much greater/smaller than your original estimate.
This method feels like a lot of work, but it gets very quick if you practice it a bit.

What has been the biggest plot twist in your life?	"On 9th of August 2012 I read a book.
That wasn't a big event. I've read thousands of books in my life.
It was a little strange that I read this particular book, because it was from the personal development genre. I had tried personal development many years ago, it ?õ????failed?õ???ù me and I decided it was not for me.
And it was quite a coincidence that both book and I ended up in the same place.
On vacation, I visited my parents in Ireland. My sister was there visiting too. She works all over the world (literally: she is a dancer and during the last season she was a dancer on a cruise ship that visited at least 4 continents). It was her book. I don't know why she was reading it. Probably someone recommended it to her. I was bored out of my mind. The book description captivated my attention.
I wolfed the book in one day.
Its message has been in my mind ever since.
Prior to reading
This book convinced me to start looking for something ""better"", not through any grand schemes or deeds, but in small daily disciplines.
Here comes the twist: after studying tons of personal development materials (a few dozen books and hours of audio programs) I discovered I wanted to be a writer.
The only things I?õ????d published in my life were entries on a couple of game forums. I had zero experience in writing for a wider audience. I had no relevant training (other than obligatory courses in high school 14 years prior).
I also had a family to support and a solid IT career, so I couldn't just quit everything and immerse in my newfound passion.
It took me more than a month to write my first blog post after that discovery. It took another few months before I started to write regularly.
Eight months after reading
I wrote and published it in English, which is not my native language. In fact, my English is mostly self-taught. I had no following and zero authority.
To my surprise, people were willing to pay money to read my book. Not much money?õ????$0.99?õ???? and not many people?õ????about one a day?õ????but I was stunned. And hooked.
I published another book. It was a flop that sold something like 16 copies in four months. My third book did a bit better: I sold over 100 copies in the first month. That was encouraging. I?õ????d sold exactly 144 copies of my books up to that moment, earning about $35 in exchange for over five months of hustle.
Book #4 was another flop.
In January 2014, I sold 197 copies of my four books and earned the ""stunning"" 2% of my day job salary. It was 16 months after reading
My approach clearly didn't pay big dividends. I was exhausted having to maintain my normal obligations and this ?õ????side hustle?õ???ù?õ????writing.
Then I published
There have been many more twists in my writing career (getting a publisher, a few more bestsellers, splitting with the publisher, getting a million views on Quora), but the most amazing twist is that
To this day, my transition from a lukewarm IT specialist to
Well, it did happen to me. A super surprising twist in a real life.

"Why is it that the left supports diversity in race, sex, and lifestyle, etc. but they don't seem to support the diversity of ideas?"	"Looking at your questions and answers, I see that you really have a bad opinion of your political opponents. So, I doubt you even want an answer, you just waneed to post a headline that says ?õ????liberals are bad?õ???ù. Basically an accusation with a question mark.
The answer, of course, is as obvious as it is simple. Some ideas are bad ideas. Neoliberalism, most religions, Racism, lassez faire Capitalism, science denial and fake news, for instance, are bad ideas.
Ideas too exist in a free market where they must survive on their merit and compete with other ideas. Bad ideas have a bad track record. They fail. They fall aside. And that is good. It is not a political thing, it is a human thing.

What are some of the flagrant breaches of ethical behaviours committed by the different actors that took place during Financial Crisis 2008?	"I think you'll have trouble finding any that were both flagrant and major. There's plenty of blame to go around, but the crisis was not caused by clearcut villains.
On Main Street, plenty of people lied on mortgage applications, and plenty of brokers helped them or looked the other way. But this has always been true, and no individual caused a significant part of the problems. A smaller number of brokers pushed people into inappropriate loans. This hurt some individuals, although not very many, but not the financial system.
On Wall Street, plenty of people packaged these loans and sold them to investors in complicated schemes. But the same banks bought a lot of the securities, so they couldn?õ????t have known they were bad. There are plenty of sloppy practices to criticize, and no doubt many people were more concerned about getting bonuses than delivering a quality product, but again, this always happens and no individual was a significant part of the problem.
The rating agencies did not do as bad a job as is often suggested. The big problem was bad actuarial projections rather than bad financial models. In other words, what the agencies got wrong is how much nationwide housing prices could fall, not what would happen to the securities if that fall occurred. And despite that problem, the really big errors were only in CDO^2s, an exotic and not particularly large market that did not trigger the crisis. You can say it was unethical for the agencies to take fees from bond issuers, but that?õ????s been going on forever, and everyone knew it. Investors don?õ????t like to pay for research.
Back on Wall Street, many firms used too much leverage. But in most cases, employees were the main shareholders, and took the biggest losses when firms failed or lost market value. Wall Street firms did not borrow recklessly, figuring someone else would take the losses.
Government and central bank actors jumped in and did a lot of things of dubious legality and wisdom. But nearly all seemed to be doing the best they could in the circumstances, and a lot of what they did worked.
The problem with looking for villains is the people most responsible for the losses, took most of the losses. They may have been stupid or lazy, but it?õ????s hard to call them unethical. You can blame investors for buying bad securities, Wall Street for packaging and selling them, rating agencies for rating them, Main Street for tolerating a lot of fraud, government for doing too little before the crisis and doing too much afterwards. But that?õ????s with hindsight, and has more to do with judgment than ethics.
Another problem with assigning blame is we still don?õ????t have a clear picture of what caused the crisis. It?õ????s easy to point to specific events, but these were all based on long-standing practices. In April 2007, when all the problems that would cause the near-collapse over the subsequent two years had already happened, financial stocks hit their all-time highs, and only hedge funds were shorting them along with subprime securities. So what changed to cause the slow-motion collapse from August 2007 to November 2008? People have theories, but no simple, clear story backed up by evidence.

Who was Raja Dahir? Is there a Hindi version of him?	"Raja Dahir was a Brahmin king of Sindh. His territory included apart from Sindh, most of Afghanistan, Baluchistan, parts of Punjab and parts of Iran. He was defeated by Mohd. Ibn Qasim of the Umayyad Caliphate of Baghdad in CE711. His head was removed from his body by Ibn Qasim, who sent it to Al Hajjai ibn Yusuf an Umayyad Governor. who was then in what is known as Modern day Taif in Saudi Arabia. The women and children of Raja Tahir?õ????s household committed mass self immolation (Johar) to avoid rape and molestation by Qasim's forces. Umayyad forces captured the rest of the women and sent them as concubines of Arab Muslim warlords and the men were sold as slaves. He had an Arab general by name Alafi who deserted him on the last moment.
After the defeat of Raja Dahir, what is now pakistan and Afghanistan were forcibly converted to Islam either by the threat of the sword or through financial inducements.
In Pakistan, the history that is taught in schools begin with Ibn Qasim and the text books ignore Pakistan?õ????s Hindu past.
Thanks to ?õ????liberal?õ???ù historians and great?õ???ùschools of learning?õ???ù like JNU our history is dictated by prejudiced pseudo historians like Irfan Habib, Romila Thapar and Ramachandra Guha, who want to hogwash atrocities perpetrated on India by invaders who professed Islam.

What is the dark side of falling in love?	"But does it start that way? No.
At the onset, there?õ????s the initial excitement, and euphoria. Waiting eagerly for every text and call becomes common, as do the wonderful dates, stolen kisses, tight hugs and cute cuddles. The entire world lies forgotten as that one person becomes the centre of your existence and your life feels perfect.
Then as time passes, months, sometimes years, routine sets in. Gradually, the euphoria dies down, the excitement settles, familiarity builds. You get used to each other. The frequency of calls and texts reduces. People get busy. Life moves on. You stop staying up all night fighting sleep just to talk to them. You don't wake up to good morning messages anymore. You meet, but not as often. Even when you do, something seems to be missing. That spark is gone.
You feel your partner has changed. Maybe he/she doesn't feel the same for you anymore. You become sad and insecure. You keep trying to figure out what went wrong, but nothing really makes sense. You become distant from each other, there are misunderstandings, fights, arguments. And then one day, it just dawns on you that you and your partner aren't compatible after all. And that it's over.
Then comes the tough part. Moving on. But that's easier said than done. You realise that it seems impossible to go on without them in your life. Because your partner was the first person you told everything to. Your confidante. Your person. Now all of a sudden, how do you let go of that? How do you accept that things have changed?
Then you blame yourself. You get angry at yourself for ever believing it could have lasted forever. But, nothing lasts forever. Things change. People change. And you have to accept it. So, you learn to cope. You try to take one day at a time. But then someone mentions them in passing, or talks about their favourite icecream flavour, or a particular song they liked?õ????and it all comes back in a whirlwind of memories.
Eventually, after days of pretending to be alright, and lots of sleepless nights, you tell yourself enough is enough. You can't stop living just because he/she isn't in your life anymore. After all, you were perfectly fine before they came along. So you learn to pick yourself up when you're low. You force yourself to go out, meet people, reconnect with friends, focus on your career, find a new hobby. Slowly, as normalcy returns, you realise that there's a whole world around you that you'd ignored when you were in love. There are other people, other experiences that are just as wonderful and fulfilling.. so you heal, you get better.
You know you've finally moved on when you hear their name, and you feel nothing. No bitterness, no resentment, nothing. You're stronger, you're wiser. You're a better person. But more importantly, you're whole again.

"Which is the better choice, UMBC or Whistling Woods, for cinematography? Why?"	"Firstly, I don?õ????t think UMBC is a comparable school to Whistling Woods. If you had to compare, I would recommend you look at NYU Tisch or USC or Chapman in comparison. These are schools that are as good as / better than Whistling Woods.
Now about the question of going overseas or studying in India.
Being a professional in any film industry is about 3 things - education / training, networking and hard work.
Professionals building partnerships with other professionals (networking) goes a long way to defining the kind of work they do. Lucas-Spielberg is one such. There are also more recent partnerships of Inarritu - Lubezki. Closer to home there?õ????s the partnership of Raju Hirani & CK Murleedhar.
Film school is about all the 3 things I mentioned - learning, networking and hard work. It is a great place to meet your future co-professionals in the industry, forge relationships and start to build out your ?õ????network?õ????.
As we have observed among our students, they form teams based on their comfort level of working together and even if one person from the team gets a break in the industry, he / she pulls in the other members of the team into the film / project that he / she is working in. We have seen such combinations develop between directors, cinematographers, Audiographers, Editors and even producers?õ????
Lastly, I have always given this advise to people wanting to know if it makes sense to study overseas or in India. If you?õ????re planning to work overseas, you should go abroad to study. If you?õ????re planning to come back & work in India, then you should never go abroad to study. The industry culture, the networking among your peers and the industry links that an institute like Whistling Woods brings to its students is unparalleled.
So, I would recommend that you study at Whistling Woods and use the money saved up to get yourself a nice DSLR or save it for the in-between period between education and making money?õ????

Should Bengaluru be included in Tamilnadu as there are more Tamil than Kannadigas ?	"Actually the population of Telugu speaking people is more than the Tamil speaking people. So by that logic, Bengaluru should be included in Andhra Pradesh or Telangana. But the population of Telugu speaking population is lesser than the Kannada speaking population.
As far as I know,
A part of Bengaluru was a cantonment and hence a part of the Madras Presidency and even now, the areas surrounding the cantonment have a large Tamilian population. But the British officials like Thomas Munro and Mark Cubbon encouraged the use of Kannada since it was the language most spoken by the people. Hence, Bengaluru was rightly included in Mysore State, which later on was renamed as Karnataka.
Bengaluru is where it rightfully belongs.

Why are people critical of Islam by relying on out-of-context passages from the Quran and Hadith and without understanding its true message?	"Why would you expect people who know nothing about Islam to be open to understanding it when they actually see Muslims in their countries asking for things like female only swimming pool times, removing christmas decorations from their neighborhoods, unusual ways of dressing, polygamy, while in their media they see other Muslims killing innocent people and fighting against each other, slaughtering humans saying ?õ????Allah Akbar?õ???ù? Why would you expect people to sit back and think: oh, here are the Muslims, that looks bad, but maybe, maaaaaaaaaaaaaybe what they?õ????re following is amazing and beautiful and full of light. If some do and make the effort of wanting to learn about Islam and read the Quran, that?õ????s because they?õ????re curious openminded people and it?õ????s good for them that they?õ????re willing to learn new stuff and try to make their own ideas and opinions. But you can?õ????t expect from all Western or non-Muslim people to do the same just because you think that Islam is amazing. Don?õ????t you see around you?? Don?õ????t you see what?õ????s happening to Islam and the Islamic world? CIVIL WAR and ALL SORTS of injustice and corruption, and fanatism growing everywhere. What do you expect people to think? I understand them, and I do not try to defend Islam in any way, because Islam is the Muslims, and I live in a Muslim society without seeing Islam in it. Oh I see thousands of veils and beards and loose dresses and mosques full of people on Fridays and during Ramadan, I see Quran everywhere being sold, and I hear Quran on tape everywhere in every store and in every cab, and I hear God said Prophet said all the time, and all I see is corruption, corruption, corruption and dirt. So I do not defend Islam because Islam isn?õ????t a concept, it?õ????s what its people make of it. Now they?õ????re giving it a bad name, so sorry, deal with it. But don?õ????t be outraged if people have a bad idea of Islam because Muslims have succeeded in giving a bad bad baaaaaad image of it, all by themselves.
Muslim countries and societies, highest rates of illiteracy, corruption, poor health care, prostitution, and I don?õ????t know what else. Muslim predicates everywhere on TV channels and the Internet preaching intolerance, narrowmindedness and spreading their ignorance to the face of the world. C?õ????mon, what do you expect? How and why would you want non-Muslims to guess that in Islam there is an Ibn Arabi, a Rabia Al Adawia, Qawwali music, a Jalalu Din Rumi, a Mohamed Arkoun, a Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd, a Nawal Shaaraoui, a Fatima Mernissi, ?õ????. how do you want them to even think that such people, figures within the diverse Islamic world even exist? Do, we, Muslims, even know these people? Do we learn from them ourselves? Do we convey anything else but narrowmindedness and ignorance of our own religion and history?? I mean, at large. And, why, why care what people think of Muslims? Is it what matters now, here, seriously? I?õ????m more worried about what Muslims think of themselves and of the chaos that?õ????s taking place amongst them?õ???? Syria, Iraq, Lybia, Burma, Southern Africa?õ????. maybe we should forget about the West and what the West thinks and just go within and ask: what do I think of myself as a Muslim? what do I think of my Muslim fellows? what on earth are we doing? do I learn enough? do I care enough? do I love enough? am I really a Muslim? (and I don?õ????t mean,doing all the rituals right oh that?õ????s so so so so meaningless without consciousness and love, it?õ????s just pointless).

"There are 40 plus Islamic nations and 70 plus Christian nations, so is it wrong to demand a Hindu nation?"	"India is already a Hindu nation, a nation where all people beyond the river Sind/Indus/Hind lives! That is what a Hindu means or the word Hindustan means - land of people beyond the river Sind!!
I know your question asks about the religion of Hinduism, which in its present interpretation by a few vested opportunists and the way you?õ????ve asked this question, cannot be compared or linked to the Sanatana Dharma. In the true context of Sanatana Dharma, India is again a Hindu nation or a nation with majority following and believing Sanatana Dharma. Now what is this Dharma or what is un-adultered vedism? I do not wish to go into debates in this area.
There may be 40 nations founded on Islamic religion and are not secular, but there are no 70 plus Christian nations. All those nations are very much secular and have a clear distinction between state and religion. Creating a country on religious identity has so far not worked well anywhere in the world, other than establishing a completely authoritarian rule for it?õ????s citizens. Religion is private and personal affair of a person, State is not, so State and religion has to have clear separation. Religion can be interpreted in as many ways as there are followers in it, but constitution has to be interpreted in only one way, same for all the citizens. This is the primary reason, religion cannot govern a nation of diverse thoughts. Even if purely religious non-secular nations, religion is a very bad form of governance.
It is wrong to demand anything less than a secular, peaceful, equal-opportunity country for everyone living within it?õ????s borders. Hinduism (Vedism) is a philosophy, it is a way of life. Stop trying to compete with other religions, that is not a race any religion can win.

What is the difference between 10 MVA and 10 MW in the context of electricity?	"MVA is the ?õ????Apparent Power?õ???ù. The simple product of voltage and current, and what has to be supplied and transmitted from generator to load.
MW are the ?õ????Real Power?õ???ù that does advantageous work. it is always lower than the apparent power, by an amount called the Power Factor (a dimensionless scaling factor of 1.0 or less)
Power factors less than 1 are caused by load impedences that are not pure resistance.
You can deconvolute current into two orthogonal vectors. One is in phase with the voltage, and the product of this one with voltage gives you the MW. The other is 90 degrees out of phase with the voltage. This is reactive. Multiply that by the voltage and you get MVAr . MVAr and MW form two sides of a right triangle, with MVA as the hypotenuse. You can use Pythagoras?õ???? theorem to relate them to each other.

Do people in non-English minority countries listen to English music the way that North Americans do?	"They certainly listen to music with English words, but interestingly, not in the way that we do.
I?õ????ve traveled quite a bit, and it?õ????s interesting to see the unique cultural stamps that get placed on the western lyrical traditions in different parts of the world, especially the American dominated styles of the 20th century.
The subtleties are hard to gain insight into, but different cultural groups seem to take American music and apply the values that dominate their culture, irregardless of the style, leading to results that can seem really comical to a Westerner.
There are a lot of examples, but one good example is K-Pop, from South Korea. It?õ????s combined a lot of classical Euro/American melodies and motifs over simple dance and hip-hop beats. Lot?õ????s of archetypal children?õ????s melodies are used, along with classical themes, which you?õ????d expect, as the listeners there have been exposed to this musical tradition for less than 70 years.
Often, the lyrics will be mostly in Korean, but with a chorus or lyrical highlights in English.
Rap is a huge part of that, and is usually mixed English and Korean.
The songs are always about love, much like most of western pop, but the hip-hop is too - and this gets strange.
Korean rappers have the same, gruff, angry aggressive tone that American rappers use. When listening without understanding, you?õ????d expect the same lyrical content as Dr Dre or Eminem, but no! There are no themes of life on the streets, violence, money, and women. They are barking about how much they miss their sweet innocent lover, or how well she will be treated if she just came back to him. They will live together for a thousand years, under the stars that are forever shining over our love?õ???? etc.

It?õ????s not morally wrong to actually send children there, since they will learn things. If they do so happen to experience the more traumatic side, as you call it, assuming they don?õ????t kill themselves and they are able to have a stable life, this will make them more emotionally stronger, at the bare minimum.
They will also gain knowledge of how to deal with certain situations that happen to them outside of the school world. Children will have, at least somewhat, learnt how people will be outside of school when they have to enter the job world. They will have an idea of those that are at jobs, and have their own way of having to deal with these people.

So, what this technique tells us is our brain tends to forget what we study at a certain interval of time. So, if we repeat the information at those interval when it is supposed to forget the most, we will be able to retain what we study.
German scientist Herman Ebbinghaus did a whole lot of research and drew this forgetting curve:
If you can see, we tend to remember only 58% after 20 minutes and 44% after 1 hour. It further drops to 36% in 9 hours and keeps dropping. After a month, we remember only 21%.
So, next time when you study, following are the time intervals you need to review what you studies to stop your forgetting curve from dropping.
After this, keep reviewing every month. You will be surprised to see how you will be able to remember it for lifetime after 10th review. It does work.

Now for a bottle numbber 28 i.e 0000011100, Rat 3, Rat 4 and Rat 5 take a sip from that bottle. This way each rat takes(or not takes) a sip from many bottles depending upon binary number (0 or 1) appearing against his assigned binary place on that bottle.
Then we wait for an hour and to let rats die. (Sorry PETA!)
Imagine Rat 3,5,6 & 8 died. It means poisoned bottle would be:
(10) (9) (8) (7) (6) (5) (4) (3) (2) (1)
Hence bottle no. 180 was poisoned.

Can anyone give me suggestions to meet up my angry boyfriend? Or is there anybody who's ready to help in Bangalore?	"First thing is get clear understanding for the reason behind his angriness.
Analyse whether his angryness is legitimate.
Since he is your boyfriend, there is nothing wrong in talking and discussing things, this would help to build emotional bonding between you both.
If he is angry because of you, then be sorry to him and discuss things with. Guys like straight forward girls.
Try to do things which brings smile on his face, rather than arguing for any matter.
There could be hundred of issues with a guy, but when he talks to his girl he will be happy. So do talk to him, he may hide his feelings and show anger, but that's not the truth.
So good luck.

What should I do in high school as a freshman to get into Caltech?	"About ten years ago I met a young lady that was admitted to and attended Caltech.
As a high school freshman she completed AP Calculus BC.
As a junior she was a finalist in the Siemens Science Competition:
In high school, if a mathematics teacher was out for the day, she could take over the class and teach it, when she wasn?õ????t attending dual enrollment mathematics classes at a near-by elite college.
She was admitted to Caltech at the end of her junior year.
I believe that she is not an atypical student who attends Caltech.
Mathematics has to be in your DNA.
And Caltech enrolls only 250 freshmen each year?õ?????õ????. From around the world?õ????..
All the best.

Is there luck exist in the world?	"life is funny ,some times you have everything ,
a wonderful job , a gorgeous girl friend, success,
great friends. And what ever you do ,
How can it go wrong at that moment?
But its not always like that, Sometimes you can feel the
sharp sword hanging against your neck , pressure from the boss,
stupid fights with the girl friend and whatever you do everything is a
mess.
Is everything happens for a reason?.
That's a very difficult question actually.
I don't know the answer,but I can say for sure that nothing
is what it really looks like. For instance take luck. Sometimes you have
felt how lucky you are to skip a long 'Queue' since you find your friend at
the front end. I reckon luck can be a curse in its disguise.
Take this, you skipped the Q and your friend bought you whatever you were
waiting to buy ,saving your half an hour from the long gigantic
and formidable Q. But on your way back you met with an accident.
Now think ,if you weren't so lucky today then would you be in that
place at that exact moment to have an accident. You can say you are
lucky to be alive, But i reckon luck and curse are not what they look
like ,

"What do we gain from drawing, sketching, and painting?"	"Now a days, with lots of gadgets and improved technology, our lives have become easy and we tend to not get enthusiastic over small things which we learn. But still when ever i sketch or paint, i get same level of satisfication, and feel that it was worth spending so much time.
By sketching/painting one can learn a ton, whether the person sketching may be a small child or even a professional who may be into this field from years. Each sketch/painting will teach something new which we carryout for rest
If I m drawing anyones portrait, I some times try to learn more about them, try to understand therir character, which in turn helps me depict the emotions in the portrait.
If i am into painting scenery, I try to put in the details to make it look more detailed and beautiful. And when ever I complete it, I will be ?õ????

Is atheism a rejection of belief in deities?	"Question as asked by the OP:
My Quora friend
I do not reject God (or gods). What I do reject, is your god story, whether it is Lord Krishna, Allah, Yahweh and Jesus, Yahweh without Jesus, Akal Purakh, Ahura Mazda, or any of the other fictional god characters in the multitude of allegedly divinely revealed religious texts.
That responds to your last sentence: ?õ????An atheist lacks belief in any gods and therefore rejects the idea of gods.?õ???ù Rejecting an idea

Which comic book should I read?	"So with The Flash, the best place to start, in my opinion, is The Flash: Rebirth.
Then after that read The Dastardly Death of the Rogues, Road To Flashpoint, Flashpoint, and then World of Flashpoint Featuring The Flash. After you finish these you can begin the New 52 Flash series, then the 2016 Rebirth.
For Spider-Man I've heard that Ultimate Spider-Man is the best series to read, so stay there and you can branch off.
As for Batman, I first started with Batman: Hush.
This is an amazing Batman storyline, it has two volumes. Then I read Batman: Broken City, and As The Crow Flies. I'm not sure where to go from there, but there's other cool storylines. Like, No Man's Land, Knightfall, Death in the Family (which you shouldn't read out of context, do research before reading this one), and others. But hey, if you want to start with the New 52, Detective Comics gives you a great intro and backstory into who Bruce Wayne is and how he became the Batman! So give that a look along with other Batman titles including Batman and Robin, and Batman/Superman.
The Joker has a really great comic called Emperor Joker, you should totally read that.
If you want to read about their Multiverses like in DC you should read Earth 2, but for Marvel there's a crapton of Earths to read about, and they get weird.
You should also try to read about the Justice League and Avengers.
But hey, I know you're probably gonna wanna read more than this. So you should check out
Anyways, I hope this helped, have a great time!

What did people believe in before Jesus and why was he pointed out as the saviour?	"Recently, I had the fortune to accompany Swami in a train journey from Narasaraopet to Vijayawada. A Christian father was our co-passenger. The conversation between Swami and the Christian father took place as given below.
Father: Those who do not have faith in Jesus Christ are destined to be consigned to the flames of liquid fire in Hell. This is the declaration of our faith.
SWAMI: Does that mean that there is no salvation to all the devotees on this earth prior to the incarnation of Jesus Christ? If so, all those devotees were subjects of prejudice of God, as they were deprived of that revelation, their successors had?
Father: God is impartial in that subject. He gave Jehovah to mankind for their salvation before the incarnation of Jesus.
SWAMI: Fine! If that be so, devotees of this land have no knowledge of either Jehovah or Jesus Christ prior to the arrival of Vasco da Gama. Vasco da Gama discovered India and only later on, the Christian literature that speaks of Jehovah or Jesus came to India. All those innocents, who lived before the arrival of Vasco da Gama deprived of the revelations of either Jehovah or Jesus Christ, were consigned to the flames of the ?õ????liquid fire?õ???? for no fault of theirs. They were not to regenerate by taking human births again and reclaim the salvation since the doctrine of the faith you follow has no place for the rebirth of the soul.
Does this mean that God intended to provide the revelation only to a handful in a small country and deny the opportunity to all those living in rest of the world? Why did God reveal Himself at a particular point of time, in a particular land, to a particular section alone? Does that not inflict the God with prejudice?
FATHER: No faith is free from such blame. Does not the faith you belong to, charge the non-believers of your faith to the same danger of hell? All mortals in other land, not aware of the virtues of the faith you follow, are subjects of the same punishment in hell! Does this also not inflict God with Prejudice?
SWAMI: There are enthusiasts who are fans in every faith. Christian enthusiasts maintain that non-believers in Jehovah or Jesus Christ shall be subjects for the flames of the liquid fire. Hindu enthusiasts maintain that non-believers of Lord Vishnu or Lord Shiva shall be subjects for affliction in hell. They further introduce and adopt sectarian salvation which limits itself to certain sections only. Followers of different sects castigate each other by such warnings.
All these partisans fail to appreciate the unity in thought of all the world religions. All these ?õ????approaches?õ???? to God, afflict Him with Prejudice. The only way to keep God unblemished is to perceive His generosity correctly.
The same single God revealed Himself distinctly in different places, in different times, to different people in different forms. He granted the same enlightenment to all in different tongues. All those faithful attain salvation upon receiving the enlightenment. Those who fail to receive are subjected to the liquid fire in hell. This approach towards God makes him unblemished. The God of all religions is one and the same. He may appear to be different due to differences in His approach to different people, in different times, in different forms and in different tongues. He nurtures all with same compassion.
The sea receives all the rivers in the same way, whether they are straight or curved. The devotion is important and not the religion or path. If the straight river becomes proud and mocks at the curved river, God will see that the straight river will never reach Him. By His will, people will build a dam on that river to divert all the water!
Every one needs to follow the path assigned in his faith to attain salvation. Every religion has different levels of spiritual enlightenment. One should move up to the higher level for comprehension of the total enlightenment. Such enlightenment alone is the means of salvation.
These levels of enlightenment in each religion are similar to the levels of education. Different religions are similar to different language mediums. The content of the curriculum is same in all the language mediums. A pupil of a certain language should strive to reach higher levels of knowledge in the same medium of his choice. He is a pilgrim in pursuit of divinity. His medium is his opportunity. It is neither superior nor inferior to any other medium. He need not move on to another language medium to uplift himself. All the language mediums are different religions at different levels of knowledge.
A school student studying science in a particular medium (language) need not change his medium, because even if he changes, the syllabus will not be changed. He should strive to change his syllabus by raising his standard of knowledge and reach to college level in the same medium. The school and college levels exist in every medium. A school student does not become a college student just by changing the medium of his class.
He becomes a college student only, when the level of his knowledge rises up. Similarly, a devotee of any religion should try to reach the higher spiritual level in his own religion. His spiritual level is not raised by changing his religion. Every religion has the lower and higher levels of spiritualism meant for devotees of corresponding stages. Religion is the medium and spiritualism is the curriculum or syllabus with different levels (school level, college level etc.,) present in the same religion.
One shall strive to reach the higher levels of knowledge that are carved out in his own faith. No one needs to move on to another faith for higher level of knowledge for the will of final salvation. All faiths lead to the same destination. In any path, you will have to proceed vertically to reach the goal. At any point of your path, if you travel horizontally, you will reach the same point of level in another path, which is a waste. The realization of this truth alone ensures harmony among different faiths of the world. Failure to perceive the truth will not make anyone enlightened.
When Swami concluded like this, the Christian Father stood and touched his heart in the model of a cross and said, ""we believe that Jesus will be born again. Yes. Jesus is again born now. Nobody else can explain like this. I am fully convinced''.
When we came to our house, Swami told me, ""see, the Christian father did not rigidly limit his mind with conservatism. Every religion contains good and broad- minded devotees. My effort of propagation of knowledge is for such devotees who are present in every religion in this world''.

"If the Earth reaches a point where the gravitational pull from the sun is exactly equal to the Earth's gravitational pull, won't the gravity be nullified?"	"First of all , where are you talking for gravity to be nullified upon.
Let me tell you their already exists some place between earth and sun where their gravitational forces cancel each other.
Now if you want gravity to be nullified upon earth's surface then that isn't possible. Gravity can be zero on a particular point on earth but not all over its entire surface at once. For all surface to be gravity free they all need to be at a equal distance from sun. Then only gravitational forces will be balanced everywhere. Since this is not possible due to geometry of earth and sun there cannot be a gravity free earth everywhere.

Closed captions on CNN are badly garbled and unreadable and have been that way for hours. Why can't CNN fix that in a timely manner?		
How can I react when I came to know that my widowed mother is having an affair?	"This reminds me of a radio show game I was listening to while driving to work one day. The prize was tickets to see Nine Inch Nails (yes, this was quite a while ago) and the contestants had to guess when the last time their mothers had sex. Then the contestant would call with the whole radio audience listening in, and ask their mother to see how close they were (they would win if they guessed the right day). I was heartened by how many people viewed sex as a positive thing, and normal, and the moms were surprisingly open about it. This was a self-selecting group, of course. The kids wouldn?õ????t dare do this unless they had a relationship with their mother that could handle this, right? I remember one mother laughing and apologizing to her son because he would have been right because of a vacation getaway, but her husband was ill that weekend (if I remember right.)
There was one caller, though, that astonished everyone. He obviously did not have the same kind of relationship as the others, and misjudged his mother badly. He said something like October 19, 1977 or something like that. His mom was a great sport and laughed and told him that they needed to have a conversation. It turned out that his father had passed away, and so apparently he assumed that she took up knitting and opened a cat shelter or something.
It?õ????s one thing to promote and support fidelity, honesty in relationships, devotion, etc. I?õ????m all for that. But insisting on another person?õ????s celibacy is wrong, regardless of the reasons. If that person chooses to be celibate, then that?õ????s their choice. But you don?õ????t get to choose when it?õ????s okay for a competent adult to have sex, just like you don?õ????t get to choose what they can and can?õ????t do in other spheres of life.
I don?õ????t know how old you are or what your relationship is with your mother. Now is probably not the best time to do anything drastic that might change your relationship. Clearly this is bothering you. When people are emotional about something, they often make bad decisions that they later regret. You do have some things you can think about, though.
For example, why were some of your moral codes and cultural norms put in place? Did they serve a purpose, such as avoiding unwanted pregnancies or making certain that first born children weren?õ????t denied an inheritance by way of a new generation born to a different father? Do you believe that sex is dirty or vile? If so, why? Was that impressed on you from a particular source? If you go back and look at that source, is it consistent in this message, or are there also messages that suggest that sex is natural and a gift for all to enjoy? If sex should be restricted, who is in charge of deciding that? (Probably not a child ?õ???? just a wild guess here.) From a scientific perspective, what is sex all about? How about from a psychological standpoint? Is having a sex life healthy for human beings, and integral to their happiness?
If you don?õ????t know how to answer some of these questions, it might be a good idea to do some reading up on it.
You might also think about what your mother would have to gain by remaining celibate for the rest of her life. She might please you if she did that, but is that really her job? Is it necessary for her to devote the rest of her life to serving you? What other rules does she have to follow to make you happy? Is she not allowed to kiss you on the cheek in front of your friends because that?õ????s embarrassing? Is she allowed to have any hobby she wants, or does she have to restrict her activities to an approved list? Can she color her hair without checking with you first? Should she balance her checkbook while you?õ????re present so that you can make sure she?õ????s not frittering away your inheritance on silly things like vacations to the coast with her friends?
Who ?õ????owns?õ???? your mom and who is in charge of her sexuality, her morality, her happiness?
You have an opportunity to control your reaction. You can, in a calm moment, examine your feelings about this. You can decide what kind of person you want to be, and follow that course, rather than focusing on the choices of someone who is not you (and your mother is not in fact you nor is she physically attached to you anymore).
If you truly think that she?õ????s doing something bad, or if she?õ????s endangering herself because of cultural norms where you live, then I hope that you?õ????ll do everything you can do protect her, because she?õ????s your mother. You might let her know that you?õ????ve noticed, and others might notice, which might lead to a lot of suffering. But in the end, it?õ????s her decision. If you merely disapprove, then make a note to yourself and if you ever have the misfortune of losing a spouse, I suggest that you don?õ????t have an ?õ????affair?õ???? after they?õ????re gone. If there?õ????s a gender bias there and you feel that it wouldn?õ????t be wrong for you to have an ?õ????affair?õ????, then maybe you should think about that as well, and where such feelings come from.
Finally, if this is really, really bothering you, you may not be able to work this out for yourself simply because it?õ????s too upsetting. Assuming it?õ????s safe for all involved, you might try talking to a counselor about this.
I honestly hope this helps!

Are you satisfied with your current job and the salary you receive for it?	"I work as a writer and work on content marketing strategy for various brands.
Location- independent/work from home or hotels
Salary- 2-2.5 Lac per month
I never liked the idea of going to office everyday but had to do that in my learning stage. Currently, I travel and work remotely.
Pretty much sums up my life, Airport

Yes, I am satisfied!
However, it took me more than four years of planning, switching various jobs across domains, learning new skills, joining various courses, and many many hardships to be here.
Edit- Since, lots of people are asking for more pictures, here is my Instagram link. :)
Edit 2- Since many people are confusing it with content writing. Its not just content writing but complete content brand promotion (including social media, marketing and sales), which is bit different from content writing.

What is the basic difference between private equity and venture capital?	"I?õ????d largely agree with
VC focuses on startups and newer companies and it tends to be in the technology sector. That means pure tech, telecom and biotech, which is a very specialized sector of VC: not too many VC?õ????s investing in SaaS or internet are going to jump into biotech because it?õ????s an entirely different skill set. VC?õ????s can range from seed stage all the way through Round XYZ, but it?õ????s generally going to be an earlier stage company. There?õ????s a blurred line with growth equity in today?õ????s market (think about some funds that are investing in stages that in previous times would have been a company that?õ????s already public like most unicorns) but it?õ????s still typically a company that?õ????s only been around for a few years and is something tech related.
A single VC fund tends to invest in more companies because they expect most of them to fail but it depends on the size of the fund. VC?õ????s funds are also going to analyze investments differently because they tend to be new companies in fields that do not have a long operating history. Sure tech?õ????s been around for a long time but a cutting edge technology can?õ????t be compared to MSFT or even Google. They can?õ????t deep dive into historic financials statements and an operating history of a possible investment because if they?õ????re a very early stage investor their target companies may not have any history and even if they?õ????re slightly later stage they?õ????ll only have a few years of operating and financial history.
When a VC invests they?õ????re looking at the product and/or service and possible market potential. They also look very keenly at the founder(s) and team in place because they?õ????re largely betting on them, especially in early stage deals. Although they will replace founder(s) and the team, it?õ????s typically not their goal when they invest (and yes, exceptions exist).
In PE you buy an existing company that has an operating history, years of financial statements, in industries where there are competitors with transactional and valuation comps to price an acquisition and they typically have cash flow that can service debt. While not every PE levers the hell out of deals, most PE involves leverage to juice returns. VC?õ????s invest pure equity (yes, there is venture debt but this is my generalization) whereas PE invests a mix of equity and debt.
PE funds will invest typically make less investments in a single fund than VC would but it?õ????s never one single investment in a fund. People can do one off deals in a fundless sponsor model but no commingled fund is going to be that concentrated. At least it?õ????s not a strategy I?õ????ve ever seen.
PE analysis is also far different because you have to look at years of financials, operating history, industry comparables and competitors (and competitors with an operating and financial history), trends and so on so there?õ????s a much greater emphasis on quantitative analysis and, honestly, complex financial models, especially because there?õ????s leverage involved. You need to stress test the model to figure out which trigger points could make you fail or increase your IRR?õ????s. Not that VC doesn?õ????t include analysis, but there?õ????s a greater qualitative part to it because while they can measure possible market size, growth and a bunch of other terms that I don?õ????t use daily, there?õ????s a much more base feeling along the lines of ?õ????do I think this team can make this product/service work at scale so that it?õ????s worth us putting money and time into their company??õ???ù
That comes to the executives and leadership. While it?õ????s easier in PE to continue with the current exec team and many PE firms market themselves as working with the incredible existing team it?õ????s pretty common to change it out completely. There are tons of examples, but the existing CFO may be an incredible growth CFO but if they?õ????re not experienced in working with a highly leveraged balance sheet and asset dispositions, there?õ????s a decent chance you?õ????ll replace the CFO. If the current executive team is a very solid team but haven?õ????t done much in the way of acquisitions and post-merger integration and your strategy is to acquire a platform company and do multiple acquisitions, you?õ????ll most likely replace them. And that will be the strategy going in. Like I said, in most VC deals that?õ????s not the strategy going in although it may happen later.
There are also more strategies in PE, at least to my knowledge. There are highly leveraged financial engineering specialists, bankruptcy and turnaround specialists, growth oriented firms, platforms with bolt-ons/rollups and others that I can?õ????t think of off the top of my head. They may sound the same but they?õ????re vastly different when it comes down to it. I worked in growth oriented and platform/roll-ups for nearly 20 years and I wouldn?õ????t be able to do a bankruptcy, or at least I wouldn?õ????t do it well. PE also covers every industry that exists. Some firms concentrate in a specific industry or a few industries, but PE will invest in nearly everything. I don?õ????t mean to oversimplify VC, but they pretty much want to invest into a tech company and see it grow. Yes there are different areas of tech and they invest at various stages of the company with different amounts of money that differentiate VC?õ????s but they generally want a company to grow in value and exit.
One isn?õ????t better than the other but they attract different people. PE folks are going to look and act like Wall Street types because they were most likely investment bankers prior to PE. While there are PE firms in nearly every city, most are in NYC or other financial centers. Most VC is still out in the Bay Area. Yes NYC, Boston, Austin and other areas have them but the hot bed is still in the Valley. They?õ????ll also dress casually and talk in paradigms that make you think they?õ????re changing the world. I?õ????m not saying they?õ????re not but most PE people won?õ????t try to blow smoke and say they?õ????re doing it for much more than the money and that they like to do deals.

"Music associated with meditation is usually slow, long tones. How can I make my drum set in jazz, a conversive group music, have a meditative affect?"	"Meditative music isn't always long, slow tones. It can also be repeated sounds that evolve very slowly. I think a rhythm pattern that has an interesting groove but no sharp accents repeated in a very precise fashion could be very meditative. Talk to your local yoga/meditation community. They are by nature very collaborative folks and I'm sure would be happy to help you with ideas.

How do I get a slim body?	"1. Eat Fewer Carbs and More Lean Proteins
You can lose several pounds by following a low-carb diet for just a few days.
In fact, lots of research has shown a low-carb diet is a very effective way to lose weight and improve health A short-term decrease in carb intake can also reduce water weight and bloating. Consume green tea thrice a day.
This is why people who go low-carb often see a difference on the scale as early as the next morning after starting the diet.
Additionally, making sure you eat plenty of protein can help reduce your appetite even further while boosting your metabolism
Try eliminating or drastically reducing all starchy carbs and sugars
2. Eat Whole Foods and Avoid Most Processed Junk Foods
When you?õ????re trying to lose weight quickly then it can be helpful to eat a simple diet based on whole foods.
These foods tend to be very filling, and make it easier to eat fewer calories without getting too hungry.
During the week, you should make sure to eat mostly whole, single-ingredient foods. Avoid most foods that are highly processed.
Eating mostly lean proteins and low-carb veggies can be incredibly satisfying even if you?õ????re not getting that many calories.
3. Reduce Your Calorie Intake by Following These Tips
Reducing your calorie intake may be the most important factor when it comes to weight loss.
If you aren?õ????t eating fewer calories than you expend, then you will not lose fat
Here are a few simple tips to reduce calorie intake:
Count calories: Weigh and log the foods you eat. Use a calorie counting tool to keep track of the amount of calories and nutrients you are taking in.
Eat only at meals: Reduce all snacks and don?õ????t eat anything after dinner.
Cut your condiments: Eliminate calorie-dense condiments and sauces.
Fill up on veggies: Fill your plate with vegetables and limit starchy carbs and added fats for the week.
Choose lean proteins: Choose lower-fat proteins, such as chicken and fish.
Don?õ????t drink your calories: Instead, opt for water, zero-calorie drinks, tea or coffee.
Protein shakes are fine if you count them as a meal.
4. Lift Weights and Try High-Intensity Interval Training
Exercise is one of the best ways to burn fat and improve your appearance.
Resistance training, such as weight lifting, can lead to a similar amount of weight loss as regular aerobic training. It also helps you add or maintain muscle mass and strength
Full-body resistance training workouts are also a great method to lower your body?õ????s carb stores and water weight, which can lead to a sharp decline in weight
Lifting weights can also protect your metabolism and hormone levels, which often decline during dieting
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is another very effective training method.
Like weight lifting, it can quickly reduce muscle carb stores and also boost other important aspects of weight loss, such as your metabolism and fat-burning hormones
You can perform HIIT three to four times a week after a workout or as part of your normal training regimen. It is very important to do this with 100% effort or intensity. Most sprints should not last more than 30 seconds.
Here are a few protocols you can try. These can done running in place or outside, or applied to a cardio machine like a bike, rower or treadmill:
Session 1: 10 x 20-second sprint with 40 seconds rest.
Session 2: 15 x 15-second sprint with 30 seconds rest.
Session 3: 7 x 30-second sprint with 60 seconds rest.
Session 4: 20 x 10-second sprint with 20 seconds rest.
5. Be Active Outside of the Gym
In order to burn extra calories and lose more weight, you can also increase your daily activity.
In fact, how active you are throughout the day when you aren?õ????t exercising also plays a very important role in weight loss and obesity
Simple lifestyle changes such as walking or biking to work, taking the stairs, going for walks outside, standing more or even cleaning the house can help you burn a lot of calories.
6. Intermittent Fasting Is Another Simple Way to Reduce Weight Quickly
Intermittent fasting is another effective and proven tool for dropping fat
It forces you to reduce your calorie intake, since you are limiting your eating to a short window of time.
There are many different protocols , such as a 16-hour fast with an 8-hour feeding window, or a 20-hour fast with a 4-hour feeding window.
If you?õ????re combining fasting with exercise, it may be wise to do the fasting at a different time than your workout.
7. Use These Tips to Reduce Water Retention
Several other methods can help you drop water weight and appear leaner and lighter. These include:
Take dandelion extract: A supplement called dandelion extract can help reduce water retention.
Drink coffee: Coffee is a healthy source of caffeine. Studies suggest that caffeine can help you burn more fat and lose excess water
Mind your intolerances: Eating things that you are intolerant to, such as gluten or
lactose , can lead to excessive water retention and bloating. Avoid foods that you think you may be intolerant to. Good luck!!

What do you think about YouTube makeup?	"I may say most of them (and their makeup styles) are not for me.
I live in a very humid place, where makeup tends to melt quickly even if I put on decent primer and makeup spray. Makeup tutorials like Nikkie?õ????s, Jeffrey Star?õ????s, Manny Mua?õ????s, and others may not be good for me. However, there are several Youtube makeup gurus that I follow, such as Lisa Eldridge, Tati, and Karima McKimmie. Their makeup styles are mostly classic and perfect for me who don?õ????t really like the very bold makeup.

How many IP addresses would be needed to assign a unique IP address to every house in India? Is the IP address space sufficient?	"Nice question first of all.
IP address is assigned dynamically by the ISP. The IP address I am using right now to write this answer, will be given to someone else once I log out or switch off my internet connection. Hence number of IP address required is a bit fuzzy.
To some extent this problem can be solved by using Network Address Translation but this has its own limitations.
Now coming to the question that is IP space sufficient. The answer is a BIG NO. Number of IP addresses are falling short to identify each and every computer/mobile devices in the world. Hence instead of 32 bit IP address, people are moving towards a 128 bit IP address. These are called IPv4 and IPv6 respectively. Hence now a days if you see, latest mobile connected to Mobile Data service will show two IP addresses if you check its internet properties.
There is Ted Talk by Danny Hillis where he speaks on how the global internet infrastructure is heavily overloaded- not only IP address pool but also everything else.
Watch that Ted Talk here :

It's not what gives you bliss or makes you happy 24/7, but what you're willing to suffer for -- what you genuinely believe to be worth the sacrifice.
The next time you feel energized and strong and like the best version of yourself -- the you that you wish you could be all the time -- pay attention to what you're doing *in that moment*. Write it down. Do this for as long as it takes until you see a pattern emerging. It won't necessarily be the activities themselves -- but they will have something in common. Look into them and behind them until you find what dramatists call a throughline: the essence of what you're good at and what drives you.
I spent most of my lifetime thinking that my passion is for writing, and for fiction in particular. But when I stepped back a bit and considered the other activities that light me up and make me feel a sense of wholeness (including my love of social media!), I realized that my passion is for emotional resonance, be it with a friend or spouse or audience or even the culture in general. I like moving into that sweetspot where something in my inner life overlaps with another consciousness, including a kind of group consciousness. That might sound like I should be lighting sticks of incense and showing off my dreamcatcher collection, but it is the *best* feeling. Writing is my main expression of that, but when I find ways to bring it into other areas of my life, I am a happy (happier) woman.
We confuse the activity with the value behind the activity. It's the value that compels us -- and which we can transfer to paid-income work in a way that changes lives (and the industry itself).
What Steve Jobs was passionate about was not computers per se, any more than it was calligraphy or Japanese gardening. It was simplicity*. He made it his obsession and his art. He introduced it to an industry that, as far as it was concerned, was doing just fine without it.
Simplicity drove the Apple identity: the strategy, the products and marketing and branding, the presentations. Simplicity enabled a computer company to connect with mass culture on a deep, emotional level, when Jobs himself was not exactly Oprah (even if he also made people teary-eyed).
Jobs brought it home just as fiercely: the complications of a couch, for example. His living room didn't require one.
Passion matters -- given that you're likely to spend more time being deeply, truly involved with work that energizes you instead of depletes you -- or makes you want to stab your eyes out with your boss's mont blanc pen.
When you can put in real, focused, quality time, you're a lot more efficient and can maybe also have a life. Imagine that. :)

What is the ideological difference between Tulsi Giri and B.P. Koirala?	"BP koirala in my opinion was a committed democrat who really wanted to help poor people in Nepal and hence he was a democratic socialist, not a full blown capitalist like many in Nepali Congress are today. BP was also a nationalist and he came back to Nepal to get away from Indian govt and compromise with the king.
Tulsi giri is not a democrat. He's a total opportunist who wants power at any cost and hence has absolutely no principles. He was foreign minister in cabinet of BP koirala but later betrayed BP and sided with King mahendra dictatorship.

How do the cumulative carbon-dioxide emissions attributable to human activity compare to historic volcanic eruptions with regard to climate change?	"Humans activities emit on order 60x to 800x more CO2 than volcanic activity per year.
It is estimated that volcanos, all kinds, emit on order 50 to 500 million tonnes of CO2 per year. Human activities is estimated to emit on order 30000 to 40000 million tonnes of CO2. Almost 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more.
In 2015, Wikipedia states that world human activities emitted 36000 million tonnes of CO2.
The eruption of Mt. Tambora in 1815 is estimated to have released 48 million tons of CO2. This was a ?õ????historic?õ???ù volcanic eruption in recorded human history as the following year or two has been described as having a year without summer halfway around the world. Volcanic eruptions emit a lot of CO2, but they are also emit a lot of sulphur, dust, light blocking particles. This resulted in some very cold summers in the years following that eruption. There were summer snows and snow in odd colors, like orange.
There have been 2 known or speculated extinction level events involving volcanic eruptions, tens to hundreds of millions of years ago (Deccan Traps and Siberian Traps). This basically means that there was a ?õ????historic?õ???ù volcanic eruption every day, every month, for hundreds to thousands of years. These were extinction level events where 70%, 80%, 90% of the living things on the planet died.
Human activity is emitted CO2 at close to or at those rates.

What is the difference between a businessman and an entrepreneur?	"I believe that the key difference between the business person and the entrepreneur is found in their mindsets. See, I have been in business for over 30 years and I have noticed that there are two different mindsets that can be used to build financially successful businesses ?õ???? the entrepreneurial mindset and the business mindset.
This difference was researched by Associate Professor Saras D. Sarasvathy, who discovered that in decision making, entrepreneurs use effectual reasoning while the business person uses causal reasoning.
While causal reasoning focuses on expected return, effectual reasoning emphasizes affordable loss; While causal reasoning depends upon competitive analyses, effectual reasoning is built upon strategic partnerships; and, While causal reasoning urges the exploitation of pre-existing knowledge and prediction, effectual reasoning stresses the leveraging of contingencies.
As I see it, both mindsets are needed to build a financially sustainable business. The entrepreneurial mindset is vital in the concept-planning to launch-establish phase while the business mindset becomes far more important in the operating-sustainable phase. This may explain why many entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs are pushed out of the companies that they found, because a different mindset is required to transition from a startup to a financially sustainable business/company.
If I could summaries the difference between the two mindsets it would go like this
Both of these views are important, but it?õ????s the position in the development process of the business that determines their value. Some of us have a strong entrepreneurial mindset bias while others have a strong business mindset bias in our decision making and others have a more balanced mindset somewhere between the two.
Fascinated by this difference, I developed a 3 test process to determine a person?õ????s natural mindset bias. Here is test #1.
Pick 10 words from the following that appeal to you, that you often use or friends often say in commenting about you. (Check the answers in the comments to find the entrepreneurial mindset answers and then calculate your entrepreneurial mindset bias % by dividing the number of words you chose against those that I believe are typical of an entrepreneurial mindset. The difference from 100% is your business mindset bias)

"Have you ever come to a point in your life where you said to yourself, ""OK, I did what I set out to do when I was young; now what?"""	"Exactly! At the age of just over 50 this question hit me like a thunderbolt.
At the age of 28, I set out to do many things: acquire a professional degree ; help my mother; bring security to my own family; put my children through university education; write a book on a professional area; increase my professional skill to a very high degree; design and build my own home; train and bring together a team of highly skilled lawyers; and set my law firm on auto cruise.
All done.
It wasn't easy. Took the best part of 30 years. Hard work. Sacrifice. Financial disaster. Recovery. Economic downturns. Disappointments. But, eventually, all done.
And then: I had no mountain to climb. I wasn't used to restful plateaus. But that is what happened for a few years. It was almost troubling period of my life. My wife would laugh. ?õ????Can you please enjoy the fruits of your labour? Go on a vacation. Take a rest. Not working is not being lazy, you know. Look! You dserve it,?õ???? etc. All fair and true. So I took her advise. But I got bored.
Something kept gnawing deep inside. I needed to climb another mountain. A big one.
I found that the biggest one was self mastery. That had nothing to do with the external world; but of the world within. The self.
The long and short of it is, I went into yoga. I struggle. The going is bad and tough. Progress is slow. It is frustrating.
But at least the climbing has started again. And I am stubborn. And I am still climbing?õ???? well, that, I am used to.
It is still there, this massive mountain range, elusive yet beckoning.
Now, I?õ????ve got somewhere to go. It is a destination no one can see. It doesn't matter. There is a quiet sense of exultation. And peace. And purpose.
I would not recommend it to all.
You asked. So I answered.

Why do people order western foods in a Chinese restaurant?	"Guessing you are from the UK. But there are some long standing traditions in the UK and other parts of the world. Chinese eateries serving some western food is one of them.
I think that in the past chinese takeaways were relatively common whereas British places were not (aside from Chippies). So we?õ????d do some western food to cover that niche. In many villages or locales there might have only been one chinese eatery, these days that is less likely.
Chinese people are practical, a few decades ago British people were not very adventurous in terms of food. Something happened to them in the aftermath of world war 2 where they seem to have forgotten how to cook or ate just crap like tinned food. Their palates were rather unadventurous for many decades and even now I still meet some Brits that only eat pizzas or burgers etc (I forced one friend to eat a small cucumber sushi and he went pale, almost fainting). There?õ????s often that friend in some groups so catering to them as well means you get their business. What is more, many western dishes are quite simple to boot.
British people often don?õ????t even look at the menu and just order what they expect you to have as they are so used to the token western dishes on most menus.
My parents used to remark that selling steaks was easy and had a high profit margin.
When my parents opened their first place of their own they had little business despite there being few eateries in the area. They had to sell fish and chips for a couple of years to survive and build the business up. That got the business in and word of mouth spread. They will eat fish and chips far more than they would chinese food. But when they did want chinese food they?õ????d come to us.
These days eateries have proliferated and there are many more steakhouses and western styled restaurants. Many of those pubs now serve food too but if you look at their food offerings they are often quite simple stuff that kitchen staff simply reheat. Their steaks and sauces couldn?õ????t compare to ours.

How does the knowledge of psychology help in facing/handling/fighting enemies/opponents/narcissists effectively?	"Knowledge is power. However, it's sole purpose isn't to defeat and destroy. It?õ????s akin to using the knowledge of science to create destructive technology; for warfare and destruction. Shouldn?õ????t it be employed to empower yourself instead?
Knowledge of psychology should first and foremost be used to understand your own psyche. When you are able to comprehend the cause and effect of your own actions, thoughts and words, you would also begin to understand others?õ???? psyche.
It sounds easy enough but isn?õ????t.
Your question is honest. If you did actually study psychology, you would know that fighting a narcissist is pointless. Would you actually wage a war against a stubborn wall that would rather be destroyed by an earthquake or a flood than be shielded for its own good? Its ego is the cost it is willing to pay to it?õ????s own destruction.
That?õ????s a narcissist for you.
A 3-tier approach to dealing with a narcissist would be:
This answer might also be useful in dealing with a narcissist.
If you notice, in none of these approaches do I try to fight or defeat a narcissist. It is really pointless. A narcissist becomes a narcissist because of painful childhood. They are unhappy miserable people who don't have a clue about who they really are. They didn't have a choice in the matter. In my good faith, I do not think they understand the hurt they cause on people. So, trying to take revenge on them would actually be a toxic thing for you to do. Compassion is key in dealing with people as long as it doesn't become a handicap for you that invites emotional predators in your life. We are all human beings in the end - neither all good nor all bad.
All the best.

Treatment: Vasoconstrictor nasal drops.

So, what this technique tells us is our brain tends to forget what we study at a certain interval of time. So, if we repeat the information at those interval when it is supposed to forget the most, we will be able to retain what we study.
German scientist Herman Ebbinghaus did a whole lot of research and drew this forgetting curve:
If you can see, we tend to remember only 58% after 20 minutes and 44% after 1 hour. It further drops to 36% in 9 hours and keeps dropping. After a month, we remember only 21%.
So, next time when you study, following are the time intervals you need to review what you studies to stop your forgetting curve from dropping.
After this, keep reviewing every month. You will be surprised to see how you will be able to remember it for lifetime after 10th review. It does work.

Is there any way to use all the SuperCash in the MobiKwik wallet?	"Not completely, but you can use most of your balance if you are regular in using the app(which is what mobikwik wants).
You can do something like, first of all decide what utility are you going to spend the cashback on, like for example you can divide a ?õ????100 recharge and recharge the number 10 times(just an example) and hence use most of your supercash.
Now, things to remember here, don?õ????t spend it on mobile recharges, you get the recharge amount minus tax, which is a waste of time and money if you?õ????re doing separate recharges. The best way I?õ????d suggest is recharging your DTH, Broadband etc.?ˇ utilities.
Also don?õ????t recharge the entire amount, like let?õ????s say you?õ????ve got ?õ????100 supercash this month which will expire in the end of next month. So start using it as said above, then recharge again in the next month, so now you?õ????ve two months cashbacks, now whatever amount you?õ????ll use, it?õ????ll deduct from the latest month?õ????s cashback(so the amount you earned during the first month can be used up completely in second month recharges, and you get new cashback in second month which will go upto third month). So if you can regularly do this, you?õ????ll lose some amount at the end(when you stop recharging), but in between you can use up a lot.

Which racing game should I play?	"I don't know if your Pc specs would be able to run the games that I recommend. But if you want the best modern racing games, Forza Horizon 3 is a must play especially if you're a casual gamer.
If you're looking for sims, Dirt Rally for rally racing or else Asseto Corsa for your 'strictly tarmac' needs. I highly recommend a proper racing wheel if you're gonna play these games.

"Which degree is harder, electrical engineering, or measurement and instrumentation engineering?"	"Recruiters know what an electrical engineering degree is - it is a piece of paper that can check a lot of boxes and make it easy for them to push you through to an interview. A measurement and instrumentation engineering degree could have exactly the same coursework, but it won?õ????t be as good at checking those boxes. For that reason alone I?õ????d say the measurement degree is ?õ????harder?õ???ù.
An EE degree opens a lot of doors because it is the common name for many related fields. Some EEs are pure E&M: They design radios, motors, sensors, etc and never touch computing. Other EEs are computer scientists, computer engineers, or software engineers that barely touch physics. We?õ????re a happily diverse bunch of engineers.
I always recommend against unusual degree names. The more common the name, the more doors it opens. ?õ????I?õ????m an Electrical Engineer with a focus in measurement and instrumentation?õ???ù will open every door that ?õ????I?õ????m a Measurement and Instrumentation Engineer?õ???ù will, and quite a few more.

Who is the strongest American Ninja Warrior?	"Drew is ridiculous. He's more than just the strongest American Ninja Warrior. He's probably the strongest

He has been the last man standing in Sasuke 32, 33, and in American Ninja Warrior 8. In Sasuke, he is the only competitor to defeat the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger. In American Ninja Warrior, he is the only one to defeat the Curved Body Prop (during a competition).
In Sasuke 31, Drew actually successfully completed Stage 3, but was controversially disqualified for using an improper technique on the Crazy Cliffhanger (he turned to face the opposite ledge before jumping, as is common practice in ANW, as opposed to turning mid-flight). He was unable to execute the alternate technique that year.
In American Ninja Warrior 5, Drechsel completed the Miami course with the fastest time both in qualifying and in the finals. In American Ninja Warrior 6, he beat the qualifying course with the fastest time of
In the American Ninja Warrior skill competition special, Drew twice set the record on the Supersonic Shelf Grab, tying with Isaac Caldiero in ANW 7 and breaking his own record in ANW 8.
This year, 2017, Drew won the National Ninja League Competition.
He came in 2nd place last year, to Geoff Britten.
Geoff and Isaac certainly compete with Drew for the top spot, but this year, I think they'd be hard-pressed to beat him. Furthermore, neither of them is competing any more. Let's hope he gets his victory over Midoriyama sometime soon.

What are the chances of a person getting into Google after preparing on Interviewbit if he is not a CS graduate and is working in an unrelated field?	"Zero. He won?õ????t get a phone screen. Companies don?õ????t accept the higher risk of less experienced candidates being unable to do their work when they don?õ????t need to. In over 25 years I?õ????ve never heard of any company hiring an engineer with that little experience.
The belief that engineers are hired for answering interview questions is incorrect. That?õ????s just a sanity check they didn?õ????t make it through a CS degree program or years in industry without learning programming fundamentals. Many CS departments have relaxed their standards so they have more students and bigger budgets. Some engineers survive for decades doing little programming, with the better non-programming engineers doing a good job in other areas like test, performance measurement, and writing white papers.
If possible companies would only hire people trusted existing employees had worked with where the candidates had performed acceptably, virtually guaranteeing an accurate performance assessment and future success. Unfortunately, too few competent people willing to leave their current jobs mean that does not work outside the smallest organizations.
We fall back to the larger pool of people who were good enough at engineering or pretending to survive a few years each at several jobs. While these peoples?õ???? resumes don?õ????t guarantee they did the work described or its quality, they?õ????re more likely to pass the interview process then succeed without years of apprenticeship than those without such resumes.
When we can?õ????t get enough experienced hires we recruit new computer science graduates who?õ????ve spent four years learning the basics required for college accreditation, finishing with a year-long capstone course where they worked on a small commercial scale project with other students.
With the US computer science degree graduation rate double the job creation rate we don?õ????t need to look farther at people who haven?õ????t done that preparation and done well enough to matriculate.
With reports of high compensation and names everyone knows, companies like Facebook and Google receive millions of applications for thousands of positions and can be pickier about who they interview so they don?õ????t have to talk to as many candidates per position. They can still hire enough when they only interview new graduates from better schools, or universities where they talk to hundreds of potential hires at on-campus recruiting events.
A degree is unnecessary when you don?õ????t need a visa to work and aren?õ????t applying to a government agency where it?õ????s a hard requirement, even at Google. Unfortunately getting the practical experience suggesting future success without one (typically several jobs which officially require a degree) is unlikely and usually more time consuming when possible.
If you have no degree, earn a BS CS degree. With poor finances, you can attend a top-notch school like Stanford which waives tuition when you qualify academically. If not, you can get in-state tuition at a state school, perhaps transferring a few semesters of credit from a more affordable community college. I know people who did that in their 30s while working full time and raising children.
With an undergraduate degree in something else, enroll in a master?õ????s program which is two years plus courses covering the basics you don?õ????t have. People with undergraduate philosophy degrees plus a MS in CS often do very well.

"According to Bible verses, who is a fool? How should you treat him or her?"	"Proverbs 26 is an excellent chapter that gives some examples on actions that signal that someone is acting like a fool.

This chapter and others in Proverbs give great advice on a practical level for dealing with people who match these descriptions?õ???? guarding our hearts, not forming close relationships with foolish people, not trusting the wrong people with our business, etc.

Is the TouchBar on the new Mac worth it?	"Thanks for the A2A.
If you had asked me this in December 2016, I would have said ?õ????yes?õ???ù ?õ???? but even then, it would not have been an enthusiastic ?õ????yes.?õ???ù Today, I would have to say the following:
If you need a particular configuration (speed, RAM, etc.) and the only model that has that configuration also has a TouchBar, then yes, it is worth it simply because you have to get it to get the other stuff.
But outside of that no, it is not worth it. Once the novelty wears off, it is more annoying than it is useful.
I use the TouchBar most for changing the volume or brightness. I occasionally use it to change the bold or italics for a word or phrase (but still favor the keyboard shortcuts for those most of the time). Most of the things that pop into the TouchBar have keyboard shortcuts, so why should I lift my hand all the way up there when it is already on the keyboard?
Far more often, however, I hit either the escape or Siri keys by mistake, and that annoys the heck out of me.
Maybe if developers find some interesting ways to use the TouchBar I?õ????ll be persuaded to use it more. But right now, I?õ????d have to rate it a fail. I think Apple should ditch the TouchBar nonsense and just give us touch screens. With a touch screen I could touch the screen for things that want to be touched and use the keyboard for all the things I do now, without having to worry about hitting the wrong thing.

Why do diesel cars smoke?	"I?õ????m gonna have to change cars to engines here for the sake of being precise.
In internal combustion engines, there is something called the
So with that being clarified, it is important to also understand variables of this ratio. Typically, the variables are on the side of the air and the fuel is constant. For the most part, the fuel measurement will always be a 1 and on the right. The left digit is a measurement of the air . In this case, the stoichiometric ratio for diesel is about 14:1. This means that 14 units of air is necessary to completely burn 1 unit of diesel. As before, these units can be volume or weight. That is, it could be cubic feet, cubic meters, pounds, grams, etc.
So here is the part where you question gets an answer:
Generally, a rich mixture, in this case, rich being below 14:1, the fuel isn?õ????t getting burned 100%. Thermal efficiency gets thrown right out the window as the fuel is only partially burning, creating a lot of heat but not thoroughly burning. This is where the smoke in diesel engines is created.
On the opposing end, if a fuel mix is too lean, or greater than 14:1, The fuel typically gets burned more thoroughly, but at the expense of power. There is only so much room in the compression chamber, and if more is occupied by air than fuel, you sacrifice power.
There is a fine balance for any engine tuning. Diesel seems to be little extra simply because of its bad reputation among environmentalists. But at the end of the day, a diesel engine done right will be more efficient and last longer than a comparable gasoline unit.

How do I get 70/70 in physics in the class 12 CBSE board exam?	"First of all, wishing you a very best of luck for your Class 12 board exams and for your future.
Well, coming to the question, you are asking how you should prepare Physics for your boards. In this answer,I will try my best to give you a good way to succeed in your boards.
Physics, is, was and always will be a big subject to all Science students appearing for board exams. The main reason for this is that the topic you have to study is a bit vast, and you need a good strategy to nail it.
As far as your Board exams are considered, the CBSE prescribes you two booksa) NCERT Textbook) NCERT Exemplar Textbook though the board, and we all know that these two books won't cater to all needs of all type of students, this is what CBSE has prescribed.For you board exams, you should be well enough in getting your concepts very well. In Recent years, CBSE has started to ask questions in a twisted manner, that makes the student to think twice before answer, so my best bet would be to use
Simply reading texts and your notes are not going to fetch you a centum in your boards. There needs to be a clever strategy to be made sure that you cover all the In text questions and Exercise questions that are given at the end of each chapter. Study all the graphs that are given alongside with the text portion. Be very vigilant in writing laws- Make sure that you don?õ????t alter the meaning of laws that were predefined by others, Do numerical questions sincerely. For this NCERT Exemplar book is really going to help you out. This book has a higher level of problems which will help you to brush up your knowledge. Also, it will help you a lot, if you are an IIT aspirant. Be sincere in your studies. Never cheat yourselves that you know everything from textbook. Once you finish this, go and try solving old question paper questions. Analyze yourselves on how you perform while solving these questions. This helps you to find where you lag or where you excel.
If you are a PCM student, you may take a look at my blog for some study materials-
Hope my answer helped you.Once again best of luck.

Why does a bee sting swell?	"Bee venom is a witch?õ????s brew of chemicals. It really is quite fascinating to me how complex it is. It is also interesting that scientists are still learning about bee venom and its components. I had an interesting discussion about this topic with my son who is a budding biochemist.
Phospholipase A is an enzyme. Phospholipids are components of cell membranes and this enzyme works on them. It ?õ????hydrolyzes?õ???ù them - that means it breaks them down. It is stimulated by a peptide called Melittin. It is my understanding that Melittin is the main active component in the bee venom.
So the enzyme breaks down the cell membranes aided by that peptide.
Then you?õ????ve got another peptide called Apamin. It is tiny and can pass through the blood-brain barrier. So that means it can get to the central nervous system. There?õ????s a bunch of interesting information out there about Apamin but those things are not directly related to this question.
There?õ????s another enzyme called Hyaluronidase. It works to allow the venom to get into the body?õ????s tissues.
In addition to the histamines released from mast cells by MCD peptide, the venom itself contains histamines. These histamines cause allergic reactions that folks have, in varied degrees.
Serotonin is present in the venom and it is partially responsible for the pain component.
Now, the swelling?õ???? most of this is due to the histamines. They can cause inflammation. Your body is trying to rid itself of the venom and that?õ????ll cause swelling among other reactions.
Something like Benadryl is often taken to address the results of a bee sting. It is an anti-histamine and it helps address the inflammation, redness, soreness and swelling caused by the sting.

What distinguishes a fascist from a very right wing conservative?	"Marxism.
Fascists are an offshoot of Marxism, therefore part of an extreme-left movement.
While the original Marxists identified a pressing threat in society in the form of the inevitable collapse of the Capitalist system and proposed that the proletariat is the ?õ????chosen class?õ???ù that should seize the State from the bourgeoisie in order to build their Utopia; the fascist thought is characterized by identifying a ?õ????pressing threat in society?õ???ù in the form of ?õ????corruption of values?õ???ù etc. The fascist proposal is a ?õ????revolutionary outlet?õ???ù: a ?õ????permanent struggle?õ???ù between the ?õ????righteous nationalists?õ???ù, who must wrestle total control of the State away from the ?õ????evil internationalists?õ???ù to cleanse society from its evils.
In very simplified terms, the essence of Fascism is the replacement of Marxian ?õ????class struggle?õ???ù for ?õ????nationalistic struggle?õ???ù and, instead of the ?õ????collapse of capitalism?õ???ù, the Fascists instill fear of ?õ????national corruption?õ???ù. The engine of History in Marxism is the ?õ????class struggle?õ???ù, while in Fascism it is the struggle between strong and weak nations.
So, Fascism is every bit as leftist as Marxism (often considered extreme-left). It is no coincidence that the totalitarian police-States that resulted from Fascist governments are very similar to the totalitarian police-States that resulted from the so-called ?õ????socialist?õ???ù or ?õ????communist?õ???ù governments that proclaimed to follow ?õ????pure?õ???ù Marxism. Conservative societies are very, very different.
The ?õ????very right wing conservative?õ???ù is the exact opposite of all of that.
The differences are many but, basically, while conservatism believe in maintaining traditional social orders and improving from that, both classic Marxism and Fascism oppose conserving social order, and pursue a desire to fundamentally alter it.

How do I decrease the bounce rate of my e-commerce website?	"According to an
So, if a web page gets 100 visitors from an external traffic source (google organic traffic for example) and of those 100 visitors, 35 visitors decide to leave the website without ever visiting a second page on the website, then the bounce rate for the page is: 35/100 = 35%.
A common mistake we see with different websites is considering bounce rate for the website as a KPI (key performance indicator). For most websites, it is not.
A KPI should have a direct business impact. Bounce rate and exit rate are important metrics to track on your website. They rarely have an impact on a firm bottom line.
The conversion rate for a website or the average order value, on the other hand, are business KPIs. They impact your bottom line.
An e-commerce website should focus on increasing its conversion rates, visits per value or average order value. Optimizing for bounce or exit rates is like chasing a ghost and will have no direct impact on the bottom line.

Who is the scariest person you have ever met?	"I meet the scariest person everyday.
He doesn't always have the same face.
I meet him in different places.
I meet him when I go home after school,when I go to the church, when I go out with my friends, when I enter the local Indian sweet shop, when I am in bus or metro station - when I am outside the safety of my home.
He scares me because he stares at me.
He stares at me the way he shouldn't and in the places he shouldn't.
He stares at every woman as if she is a mere piece of flesh.
My glares do not always work.
The scariest person doesn't always have the same face or the same name.
He inflicted in me a general fear towards men. His obscene stares have wounded me.
Whenever I walk alone I am scared of him pulling my hair from behind or hitting my head. You know what he can do...
He is out there.
He doesn't need to touch me to hurt me. He taught me that looks could kill.

Why are most academics not very friendly?	"Well, academic fields do attract a number of introverts, who are more comfortable in a lab or library than a cocktail party. Is that what you mean by unfriendly? Beyond that personality trait, the question needs context. At what location do you see these unfriendly academics? At a university or outside of work setting?
Start with a university campus. A common misunderstanding arises on campus. Most students visit a campus as a ?õ????trip to the classroom.?õ???ù Tourists visit campuses for many reasons, to see famous buildings, to visit a local museum, or simply to absorb the energy of the central quad. Most people do not treat a visit to a university campus like a trip to the office, but ?õ???? hey, guess what? ?õ???? faculty do. Most are focused on the immediate task at hand. They are pressed for time. They have 87 things to do in less than 8 hours. Think about how most pressed professionals behave at their offices ?õ???? they are overworked and stressed. They may be polite, and that is about it. Friendly is not a priority. in this respect, academics are not particularly different than any other professional at their office.
Let?õ????s try outside of a work setting. Again, academics are not particularly different from any other professionals ?õ???? doctors, investment advisers, real estate lawyers, and engineers. They like to talk about their own work experience, and the broader trends they observe, and gossip about various people they know. Do any of those interests overlap with yours? Think about how you react when you encounter someone with whom you have nothing in common. Again, in this respect, academics are not particularly different.
Now, quite honestly, I might take issue with the premise of the question, that most most academics are not friendly. You just have to get them at the right moment, when they are not harried by work-related issues. Just like anyone else.

"Assuming that Quantum entanglement cant send information, what is its role in quantum computing?"	"This is a great question for teasing out some quantum subtleties!
Without ?õ????spooky action?õ???ù, i.e. computing classically without quantum, if you want to modify every variable you must act on every variable. Quantum computing lets you get away with violating this seemingly immutable law. This is why in my answers elsewhere I decry the fixation on ?õ????spooky action at a distance?õ???ù. To me ?õ????spooky action locally in a computer?õ???ù is much more perplexing!
Warning: this compute power awesomeness comes at a staggering algorithm and coding price. See
So now back to communication: The only way to measure if two particles are entangled is by measuring them both and comparing the result. Comparing transmit and receive isn't communication since the comparison itself
Game over, Cheers!
In answering over 2,000 questions from ~4,000 users I've never stated an open research problem as part of a question answer. But I will here.
?õ????Entanglement disallows communication but allows awesome compute power. In both cases, the ?õ????hidden-ness?õ???ù of quantum states, itself coupled to the HUP, is the key ingredient.
Question: Is there a deeper reason why these two properties coexist? Is the ability to evince communication somehow inversely proportional at a fundamental level to the ability to compute ? If so will we see this manifested in quasi entangled quantum species (discord)??õ???ù

What research areas can I work on for my PhD?	"Between having a background in engineering and applied statistics, you have an uncountable number of ?õ????good?õ???ù options, depending on your personal interests and motivations.
A couple of my thoughts, since having started a PhD and tried out multiple topic areas. This is how I would think if I started again.
First, look for a topic that you think will improve the world. A PhD is only worthwhile if you have motivation that extends beyond the economics of your decision to pursue it. It needs to be a mission. 80000 Hours has a great list of pressing problems. (
Second, choose a topic that you would love to talk about on a walk with your best friend. You will spend a lot of time with your research colleagues, and hopefully you will develop great friendships with many of them. This is what really makes research worthwhile. Having a team to conduct your mission with. For an example of a beautiful collaboration between researchers, I would point to you to reading the introduction to Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman, which describes his collaboration with Amos Tversky.
Third, think about the professional prospects of your project and skills you will build through it. A low graduate stipend and uncertain career prospects can result in anxiety that makes it hard to do good research.

Most Visa gift cards sold to customers at retail locations like grocery stores in the US will work only with merchants in the US. You cannot carry them with you and use them overseas. They will also not work if you try to use them with online merchants outside the US.

Would Captain Kirk be qualified to work at NASA?	"Beyond qualified. Kirk was a Starfleet officer. Graduating from Starfleet academy would be an educational experience that would eclipse our own. It's widely shown that education has progressed with technology. Most Starfleet officers are accomplished scientists, with advanced knowledge of astrophysics, math, history, and engineering. Most any officer can calculate warp mechanics or fix advanced systems. The vast majority of Starfleet officers would be educated to a level unthinkable today. But, how educated are you compared to 300yrs ago? Would the captain of the USS Nimitz be considered educated by their standards? I expect he'd be a pillar of education in 1600.

However, we love tofu in all it's many forms, and eat it almost daily in this American household. Years ago our youngest daughter did a year abroad in Nagoya, Japan. The dorm she stayed in was for foreign exchange students, and had a shared kitchen. Naomi was cooking her dinner of a stir fry with tofu and veggies when a Chinese student wandered in. The girl was almost offended that Naomi was cooking tofu. ?õ????Why you use tofu? That Chinese food!?õ???ù Naomi just said it was also her food. It was a good chance to explain that not all Americans only eat beef and potatoes.

To what extent can artists utilize unlikely media and still have their work be considered art?	"Artists can do what they want in terms of materials?õ???? up to a point.
But to succeed in the very big leagues, curators and museums use overt as well as unspoken lines to divide up art. So as one experiments with media, which category do you end up for curators?
For example, artists working in the form of the book have no home in museums. Curators don't know what to do with them. So I saw an exhibit of an artist last year at MOMA who was primarily a painter. But he had some some mediocre books so MOMA put a lot into displaying them, (interactive displays, etc). But real artists of the book? Nope. Not at MOMA.
Same with fabric. There is a classification of ?õ????fiber art?õ???ù. But within that class there are a lot of art quilters creating visually stunning breakthrough work. But don't let that term ?õ????quilt?õ???ù near a museum. And, even among art quilters category lines have developed and a lot of stuff can look the same.)
On the other hand, ?õ????found art?õ???ù and ?õ????outsider art?õ???ù are both popular with curators right now (even tho ?õ????outsider?õ???ù is now made by insiders by putting out low quality work).
Despite the art businesses self perception of cleverness and willingness to break with tradition?õ????don't count on it too much. It's still a business and that means it has coagulated into categories, pigeon holes, and limitations?õ????covered with a patina of ?õ????breaking with tradition?õ???ù.
Some of this is driven by what people will buy. And while high end collectors can be risk taking, the vast majority of the market lives within some fairly safe boundaries. And that's why sunflowers and dogs sell so well as topics - to the incredible frustration of artists who make far more interesting work.
I thoroughly endorse experimentation. Just be aware that when an artist does something truly breakthrough, the established world won't rush to embrace it (unless it's a simple to understand circus act like John Cage or Andy Warhol).

Why are extremely religious people often the biggest hypocrites?	"Well, because religions place fairly high standards of behavior to follow with some clearly defined and unforgiving consequences outlined. It?õ????s hard to live up to that. So they make up exceptions to their rules to forgive themselves and no others. Obviously, they are going to heaven, but everyone else can go to hell.
Now, obviously, not everyone ?õ????covets his neighbor?õ????s wife?õ???ù, but some might have a strictly physical interaction with her with NO intent to steal her from her husband. You know, just a bit of nookie. OR have no extramarital affairs but have lots of pre-marital sex. No harm no foul. But a religious person views the world differently. He condemns these actions and the people doing it. He becomes irate and distraught. Of course HE does it too, but wonderfully he won?õ????t go to hell because his lord and savior gave him a get out of hell free card for accepting him as god. So it?õ????s OK for him to do it, just not anyone else.
To them, a kid shoots someone dead while robbing a liquor store is going to hell, but cousin Eustis who?õ????s in prison for raping and killing a baby is going to heaven cuz he?õ????s got a personal relation with his savior.
So this logic applies to everything they do. Con men televangelists and faith healers are excused, racial hatred and violence is excused, violence against homosexuals is excused, abuse of women and children is excused, hatred of heretics (Atheists and Agnostics) and infidels (every other religion) is excused. In fact, whether it?õ????s angels and harps or virgins and honey, they think violence and hatred guarantees their going to heaven. It?õ????s the ultimate cop out.

"The Law of Conservation of Mass states that mass cannot be created or destroyed, so where does all our food's mass go? It is not all excreted/gained."	"In fact it is all excreted or used by the body in some way. You may not realize this due to the significantly different rates/methods of excretion, but ultimately all mass that comes into the body must all leave the body in some way. For example, one good method to see just how long something can ?õ????stick?õ???ù around in the body is the ingestion of heavy metals. Ingesting strontium for example can stay in the bones for up to 40 years as measured in some tests, and potentially even longer. Furthermore you can?õ????t really measure all rates of excretion from the body. Because of the complex input/output stream rates therefore the mass balance in the body can really be extremely difficult to track.

Do you agree that the Hindi is losing it's importance in India?	"I?õ????ve been on twitter (
Both these factors have brought back Hindi to life which was thinning away 2 years back in my opinion (and I can say that with command since I?õ????ve been blogging (
Part time poets, writers, thinkers and for that matter, every Ram-Shyam-Ghanshyam who has access to internet through a smartphone is now generating content in Hindi at such a rapid pace and in such volumes that it was almost unthinkable just 2 years ago.
I am very happy to see that there are 1000s of websites which entirely serve vernacular speaking people and they?õ????re doing quite well. Lakhs of phone apps cater these people. Even my own father owns a smartphone now and he regularly reads news in Hindi and also converses on WhatsApp in Hindi. It is a tremendous feeling to see him getting used to technology through a smartphone, internet and easy Hindi typing keyboard.
I predict that all Indian languages which were limited to few people and region will witness huge surge in usage and will give stiff competition to English. We can at least have a sigh of relief that technology has helped our own languages which were considered lesser than English.

Child-free couples: what are the advantages of having no kids?	"I think the first, and obvious, answer is the freedom. We are free from stinky diapers and screaming grocery store trips. If we wanted to take a sporadic trip to the Pacific Northwest, or up to New England, we wouldn't have to worry about if we packed enough diapers [tots], or if we have enough data on our phone plan [teenagers].
My husband and I are also able to save money much more efficiently than if we were to have children. There is no added cost: diapers [disposable or reusable] food/formula, clothes, and a myriad of other expenses. Not only that, but the birth itself [depending on your insurance] can cost anywhere from $20 to over $10,000.
Our marriage is much more fuller/richer because we can focus on our relationship. It sounds selfish, and it is. When you become a parent, your attention shifts from your partner to your new child. While it might bring you closer together, it can also tear people apart. That?õ????s why you have people on Quora who say they regret having children.
We also aren?õ????t raising our children in this shit storm [pardon the language] of a country. We don?õ????t have to worry about our children growing up with cyberbullying or face-to-face bullying, child predators, drugs, or them worrying about whether they are cool enough like someone else?õ????s kids. We won?õ????t have the anxiety that comes with being a parent, when your kid decides to break curfew, or text and drive.
There are a lot of advantages to not having children, but let me end with this: My husband and I do not feel like we are living a life with less purpose. It is not our responsibility to populate the world - it is our responsibility to enjoy the life we have created with each other, and for us that involves no children.

Are raw diamonds expensive?	"An uncut diamond is a stone that has not been shaped in any particular form by a professional cutter and has not undergone any polishing. Uncut diamonds are also referred to as rough diamonds (or raw diamonds). Usually, after they are mined, those uncut diamonds whose quality is high enough to make them suitable for jewelry are sent to be cut by jewelry professionals.
Let us take a look at what makes an uncut stone more or less valuable:
Based on these factors, the price of a raw diamond might vary.

Why are people able to become famous at this time without doing much of anything?	"Why are people famous for doing not much of anything? This is how culture works now that there is internet.
Before internet, you needed to do something culturally significant to even be recognized. That?õ????s because most media was both
The order of things was that if you couldn?õ????t find something culturally significant, and worth the price of putting it into an existing program, it didn?õ????t go anywhere.
The internet, like VHS tapes, fliers, and cassette tapes before it are disruptive to this order. Now instead of even needing to hand something out, you can just put it up somewhere and eventually people will find it. For instance, I just bought

Is the current American drug problem similar to China's First Opium War?	"Yes,
Of course, it quickly expanded into non-opium trade related finance, but that was how it started.
If you read about HSBC in the news, they continue to frequently get fined for large amounts of money because they continue to violate money-laundering laws.
The drug problem in the US is mainly demand-driven; Americans like their illegal drugs, and have managed to convince themselves that they are unhappy without them.
The opium trade in China was mainly government-policy driven, by the British.

What would you absolutely love to see in Star Wars: The Last Jedi?	"More than anything, I?õ????d like to see the
There?õ????s a lot we don?õ????t know about Luke as a Jedi ?õ???? most of it, really. He came into his own just in time to do what was needed by ROTJ, but there are many unanswered questions. What was his approach to teaching? Which parts, if any, of the Jedi belief system as conveyed to him by Obi-Wan and Yoda did he not accept? How did Obi-Wan?õ????s bad-faith deception and subsequent justification influence Luke?õ????s thinking?
Star Wars is great, in part, because it?õ????s self-reflective. It manages to be a ?õ????stable,?õ???ù timeless mythology on one level, but also reflects changes in the world, including beliefs, attitudes, etc. Which, really, all mythologies do ?õ???? some better than others, of course. I?õ????d like to see the new film deal with the aspects of Jedi philosophy with which many people have become increasingly uncomfortable.
I don?õ????t mind ?õ???? I really appreciate, in fact ?õ???? much of the thematic and narrative repetition and mirroring in SW. It seems to me that recurrence has always been a major part of the fabric of the SW story. But if Luke?õ????s ?õ????fall?õ???ù is just a smaller-scale version of the fall of the Jedi as seen in the prequels, if Ben?õ????s fall is just a mirror of Anakin?õ????s, I?õ????ll be more disappointed than if we get yet another Death Star.
The Jedi of the Republic era were raised in an orderly society, and could afford to have beliefs - even hugely damaging ones - which wouldn?õ????t hold water in the world at large. They could cling to this weird idealism because of their separation from the rest of society, their status and privilege.
I want that to be different for Luke and the rest of the people who were attempting to raise a new generation of Jedi after the destruction of the Empire. I want it to matter that they were born into a galaxy where ?õ????order?õ???ù meant Empire, and which was otherwise and afterward a galaxy in shambles. I want it to matter that the rebellion required precisely the kinds of passion orthodox Jediism had rejected. I want Luke to have reflected on the problems with Kenobi?õ????s ?õ????certain point of view?õ???ù and have taken that with him as he attempted to ?õ????reboot?õ???ù the Jedi Order.
I?õ????m not talking about ?õ????grey Jedi?õ???ù stuff. I?õ????m talking about really questioning what it means to be a Jedi, what is essential about it. The prequels established how the political structure of the Jedi Order led to their downfall. But I want to see some recognition that the repressive, emotion-denying, identity-cleaving nonsense which allowed Kenobi to call his lie a truth with a straight face was even more at fault. It?õ????s what allowed Vader to happen. There?õ????s no version of Luke I could believe in who wouldn?õ????t have seen that and taken issue with it.

Are citizens of the UK prepared to pay 60 billion euros to complete the process of exiting the European Union?	"According to Wikipedia the GDP of the uk is about 2.8 trillion dollars. The economic consensus on the impact of brexit is a long term GDO drop in the region of 4% (with a wide error margin because there are so many unknowns). That's a cost of leaving at about 112 billion dollars per year (90 billion pounds per year), not a one-off cost.
I think the 60 billion cost mentioned is a reworking of the 20 billion euro estimate the FT made, of outstanding commitments to pay for things like people's pensions and existing projects in the EU ?õ???? a one of payment which might be averaged over ten years. It amounts to a tiny fraction of the total economic cost of brexit.
Perhaps it's being inflated by anti-EU campaigners to try to distract people from the real costs?
Citizens are not prepared for the real cost (mostly they don't know about it), but will probably be deceived into not noticing until too late. I can just imagine the UK government giving itself a pat on the back for negotiating down the fictional 60 billion to a realistic figure, while conveniently ignoring the general drop in inflation adjusted income, social services, and general prosperity throughout the UK.

How do I create a face in Roblox?	"You aren't able to make your own face on ROBLOX and put it on the catalog for everybody to see and take for a payment of robux. Although you can't do that, you are able to make your own face by going into the files of ROBLOX on your computer and change the default face into whatever face you like by changing the image. This is only client side sadly.
Then there is always the option to make a decal on ROBLOX by going to develop, then decals, insert your image, then create. Once you've created your decal, go to ROBLOX studio and insert a script. Code the script into making it so whenever you enter that game, the script changes your face into the desired face your want. This will only allow you to have that face in
If you're looking into making your own face for everyone to see, there is always exploits available to do this for you but I highly not recommend it. Sadly I'm not the best at scripting on ROBLOX so I can't help you with the scripting on option two. Hope this helped.

Is it harder to become a billionaire or stay a billionaire?	"It is harder to stay one ?õ???? by far.
People who don?õ????t have money always believe that when you do have money, all your problems are solved. Nothing could be easier than simply spending millions and billions. Your only problem set is picking out the quality of service and level of luxury in what you pick to get though each day.
In fact, people with money tend to get owned by their money. It ends up owning them, instead of the other way around.
From the moment you wake up until the moment you go to bed, people will be after you to do something .. loans, gifts, investments, charity, taxes, confiscations, lawsuits, theft, competing with other billionaires, losses on sports teams, donations to endowments, your partner on yet another spending spree, etc.
Even what you own can own you. If you own a 100 suite apartment building, you actually don?õ????t own it .. it owns you. Every time a tenant complains, you have to pick up the phone.
When you die, the government wants half. When your children die, half again.
Until there is nothing left.
To make a billion is hard ?õ????. to keep it intact over 200 years, a hundred times harder.

What are your tips for studying chemistry?	"The best way to become better at studying for chemistry (as well as understanding it) is by enjoying it. Easier said than done, I know- but chemistry has its lovely intricacies and beauty.
The next best thing you can do for yourself is further develop your understanding of chemistry is focus on the rudimentary skills and fundamental concepts. Stoichiometry, atomic structure, periodicity, and the fundamental rules of thermodynamics will dictate everything you see and do in chemistry. Atomic structure is something you should take extremely seriously when study for AP level exams. Bonding and geometric structure becomes easy once you understand the structure and behavior of the varying elements.
Memorization is your best friend: Know your polyatomic ions, functional groups, periodic trends, and anything you can think of that would expedite your test taking.
Use the resources given to you. Although the ancient textbook your teacher lent to you may be helpful, getting a different view of chemical phenomena will be invaluable. Khan Academy is a wonderful resource for review and solidification of material.
Hope this was helpful!

I suppose someone somewhere might have such an intense fetish for extreme height that they'd rather deal with an ugly, smelly jerk who is extremely tall than a rad guy who is somewhat tall. Similarly, someone somewhere might be so into giant breasts that they'd choose a hideous harpy with FF's over a beautiful charmer with D's. That'd be pretty weird, though, wouldn't it?
Chill out about height. In fact, chill out about any individual trait. Sex and relationships are rich, complex experiences where many traits affect the quality of the experience, and so people choose partners based on many traits.

What is downsizing organizational development?	"Through the use of Social Network Analysis (SNA) tools, I believe that OD has a place at the table in down-sizing efforts.

The interesting finding was the ?õ????hub?õ???ù of the group was about to be promoted and they ?õ????NASA Managers?õ???ù were going to put in place a person that was not suited to be a communication ?õ????hub?õ???ù so they made a change.
For while I am certain that there are financial reasons for downsizing and reallocating resources, I am equally certain making those decision when SNA data was absent is destructive to the social structure of the organization. SNA has a role to maintain the social fabric of the organization and ought to have a place at the RIF table besides accounting.

Why has India discriminated against minority people by banning eating beef?	"I have my view to share but before that, I think those who eat beef in India represent a majority. Beef is one of the cheapest meats and only a small segment of our population is vegetarian by tradition which is in fact the minority. There are non-vegetarian Indians who don?õ????t eat beef over various concerns [health/religious etc.]. India has not discriminated against minority people but India has population groups who are being discriminated by dominant groups. majority/minority is a highly subjective thing and variable over geography and time. Cow slaughter is banned but the beef we consume comes from Buffaloes. Indian, as it turns out, is one of the top-2 exporters of beef, globally.
You do bring an interesting and hard-to-digest fact here that such discrimination is live and growing in India as we speak. Lifestyle choices are colored with culture and right now, we are trying our best to save our own cultures by destroying others?õ???? cultures. We need to understand the concept of competitive coexistence and start tolerating differences. If we can?õ????t tolerate someone else?õ????s culture, that is the proof that our own culture is so badly designed that fellow humans are finding it hard to survive along with us. If we can?õ????t treat other cultures equally, then it only means, our cultures have not taught us how to treat other cultures equally. if we are going to demand fair treatment from everyone else before delivering from our end, it only means our culture is not capable of delivering value but is only capable of exchanging value. If you have to kill someone to save your god and its principles, then letting you kill someone makes your god unfit to be any god to begin with. The credibility of the religion goes for a toss from that point on and I think I have made my point.

Life has whatever meaning you give it. What you do with that life, what your goals and desires are is up to you.
Some people want to devote their life to another person (male or female, opposite or same sex) and some do not.
For instance, priests, nun, monks etc. do not (at least in theory) have girlfriends/boyfriends.
Other people get meaning from their work. Lots of scientists, artists, authors etc. live their lives without ever having permanent relationships. Isaac Newton for example.

Who may be the best replacement for K. L. Rahul for RCB who will probably play XI?	"Yes a truly unfortunate incident for all RCB fans especially since their skipper is also suffering an injury and will miss the first few games.
(
Honestly I believe there are no proper replacement for KL Rahul from among the pool of available capped and uncapped Indian players. Taking a foreigner instead of him is also not wise as the team already a good four in AB,Gayle,Watson and Mills.
But there is nothing to worry about as RCB has a plethora of batting talent. So from among the present squad members the following team could be formed :
+ 4 regular bowlers
Other options- Mandeep Singh
P.S: The middle order might seem a little inexperienced but in a week or two captain Kohli would be back to replace Watson at the top. Watson can then be transferred to no.4.

What are nonpotter fans are called?	"I've mentioned this a few times, on a few other comments, but never created an answer around it.
There are 5 levels of people in this world.
Level 1 - Those that aren't Harry Potter fans, some call them muggles, I call them bitches. They ask questions like ?õ????How do you escape an indestructible room with no doors or windows, have I beaten Quora User yet??õ???ù They ask questions like this because they are not fans of Harry Potter.
Level 2 - People that watch the movies and call themselves HP fans. I call them bigger bitches, and arguably far worse than level 1 bitches, because at least those level 1 bitches are being honest. These people are delusional, and create questions like ?õ????Why did Harry snap the Elder Wand at the end of Deathly Hallows??õ???ù
Level 3 - Legit Potter fans AKA Potterheads, these guys and gals have read the books and know the story well. They have seen the movies and understand THEY ARE NOT THE SAME. They get hung up on details that may or may not be directly expressed in the text, possibly asking questions like ?õ????Is home schooling allowed in the wizarding world??õ???ù because most don't know the answer is on page 210 of The Deathly Hallows.
Level 4 - These are hardcore Harry Potter fans, intense Potterheads.

They know pretty much everything in the books but they can't merge concepts not touched upon in the series with canon compatible answers. They create insane questions like

When jets dump fuel prior to an unexpected landing how do they prevent spraying the boats and the people below?	"Gasoline and Kerosene (the basic constituent of jet fuel) are both very volatile - which means that it evaporates very quickly when exposed to air outside of a container. Given that the plane is moving a few hundred miles per hour, the stream of fuel is literally sprayed as a fine mist into the air and as a result it evaporates almost instantly, long before it hits the ground even if released at a few thousand feet.

"Can I learn to play guitar on my own without any coach? If yes, then suggest how should I start it?"	"While this question seems rather straight forward, there isn't one concrete answer that will apply to everyone.
Before I get ahead of myself ?õ???? YES, one can absolutely be entirely self taught on an instrument. I've been playing guitar for 18 years, starting at 13yo, and have never had a lesson. I'm entirely self taught on the guitar, bass, and piano.
That may be reassuring, and I don't say this to take the wind from your sails, but some people have a natural ability for playing music. I am one of those people. Music, and how to play it on an instrument, just makes sense to me. I usually figure out how to play a song listening to it while driving (I'm taking chord progression, not solos). As in, without the sheet music OR a guitar. And most of the time I can play it as soon as I get out of the car.
That isn't to say I never ask for advice, or read books/watch videos on technique, use tablature, look up chord progressions, etc.
To the other extreme, some people just have a hard time learning guitar, or any instrument for that matter. Even with years of lessons and practice, the ?õ????aha moment?õ???ù ?õ???? where something clicks and the student begins to truly ?õ????get it?õ???ù ?õ???? doesn't happen for everyone.
Now, I don't mean to imply that if one doesn't possess an innate musical ability there is no chance to learn the guitar, even with instruction.
Most people will fall somewhere between the two examples I've listed above.
Tablature is a great place to start with self instruction. But it will only show finger position, and lack all the necessary playing techniques picked up through instruction, years of playing, or both.
I'd recommend taking a few guitar lessons ?õ???? whether in person or online is up to you ?õ???? to see if things click easily for you.
If you're having a hard time, that doesn't mean you won't be able to learn. It
But if the guitar truly makes sense after some introductory instruction, you may just be a prime candidate for learning on your own.

"It appears to me that it would make more sense to fix our immigration laws and then enforce them.

I have no issues with immigrants from our southern borders, the majority are hard working and law abiding.
Actually my only issue is when I went to the Social Security Administration to file for assistance and then given the run around for months on end, I was taken back by the amount of interpeters working there assisting people who very much appeared to me haven't been here long enough to file for retirement benefits, much less learn english.

Do high IQ individuals really not care about IQ?	"I was tested to be north of 160 (not accurate beyond that point so I don't specify more than that). I know it can be hard to not have an ego when you're just better at some things than everyone around you. But it's important to remember that you have this IQ through no action of your own. You were born this way the same way anyone else is born tall or white. It seems wrong to think yourself better than others because you're taller and it's clearly very wrong to think that because you're white. Intelligence is no different. Sure, it offers more benefits. Yes, you have a lot of potential, but that doesn't make you better. I have met a LOT of smart people and I can't stand the arrogant ones. It's okay to care about IQ if you want, but you'll realize over time that it doesn't mean as much as you thought.

What do you think of your own name?	"Damn, that?õ????s a
When I used to do author visits at elementary schools, there was inevitably one child who would ask to call me Ms. CJ, because their mother, or father, wouldn?õ????t like it if they said my ?õ????other?õ???ù name.
I suppose I could have changed it back, when I got my last divorce. The judge did ask if I wanted to keep this name, or go back to one of
?õ????Other names??õ???ù you ask ?õ????
I was born, Catherine Jo Parrish. Mama originally wanted to name me, Paula, but when she and Daddy talked further about it, they realized the kids at school would call me Polly. With Parrish, it would be Polly Parrish and they would tease me.
?õ????Polly want a cracker??õ???ù
My great aunt?õ????s name was Catherine, so that was chosen. My middle name, Jo, came from both my mother and father. Dad was Joseph. Mother was Joanne.
Later, my publisher advised me to use the CJ with Heck as my author name for my book. They felt it was catchy and it would work well with children in the schools I would be visiting. ?õ????
Anyway, my first marriage changed the Parrish to Kempf. My second, changed it to O?õ????Brien, and with my third, it became Heck.
When the judge asked if I wanted to keep Heck, my first book had already been out for seven years, so I kept it.
So legally, I have been Catherine Jo Parrish Kempf O?õ????Brien Heck and now, finally, C.J. Heck.
Interesting? I think so. I like my name just fine, but it?õ????s also why I don?õ????t want to get married again and, thank God, Robert is okay with that.

Is there a shooting range in IIT Bombay?	"No, unfortunately there is no shooting range within IIT B itself.
The shooting range nearest to IIT B would be the Tolani College shooting range which is about 7.7km from IITB. In peak traffic it would take 20 minutes by a cab which is quite decent as per Mumbai standards.
The Tolani College range itself is pretty good. I have played many district level matches at this range and also broken the district record here. The following is some information about the range itself from the Tolani College website.

More than three-quarters of guns used in mass shootings have been purchased legally. Can we consider that the 2nd Amendment is a permission to kill?	"What a SILLY question! Are you trolling?
OF COURSE NOT! But I will entertain your provocative question:
The second amendment grants the right of civilians to own arms, not to kill. That some disturbed people chose to kill and a SMALL number select a gun to do so does not reflect the many millions of guns legally owned in the US and never used to kill.
Consider: Deaths annually in the US (suicides excluded, being intentional)
-8,500 gun murders (half are gang-related)
-25,000 falls
-39,000 poisoning
-42,000 auto
-71,000 diabetes
-88,000 Alcohol
So of the 8,500 gun murders with almost all being criminal acts, a very tiny portion is the mass shootings (9 mass shootings in 2015, 4 in 2014). it is an unfortunate fact of life we almost always cannot know when an individual will ?õ????Snap?õ???ù and commit homicide. Consider:
-When they use a truck to plow into a group of people (France, Germany), do we call for the banning of trucks?
-When 42,000 people get killed in an auto accident, do we take all cars away from the populace?
-39,000 people are poisoned every year?õ????do all potentially dangerous substances get pulled from the shelves?
-When 911 happened, did we pull all pilot?õ????s licenses and flying schools as they were ?õ????permission to kill?õ???ù?
Keep in mind criminals can always get illegal guns, so the current restrictions and gun laws do not stop them. Even if you ban all guns from the hands of honest citizens, bad guys will get guns.
Here is something to ponder; WHAT IF in each mass shooting there was someone in the crowd with a legally owned carry weapon. WHAT IF that person with the carry weapon used his/her legally owned gun to stop the mad man and prevent the mass shootings? How many lives might be saved before the police arrived (and they always arrive too late)?
But the 2nd amendment has NOTHING to do with killing.

"As an evangelistic Muslim, who would you rather convert, a non-Muslim or a Muslim from a different sect?"	"As someone who actively does dawah?õ????
Thats honestly a hard thing to decide?õ????.yet, I would choose the Muslim from a different sect.
You can work your whole life trying to convert someone who was just not chosen to be Muslim and thus waste your time and energy.?ˇ Only Allah swt decides who can become Muslim, so trying to convert a non-Muslim is nearly 50/50 on whether they will forever remain a non-Muslim or become a Muslim.?ˇ Also the post-conversion rate of Muslims staying Muslims is risky, I could work for years just to have them completely leave Islam.
So I would choose the Muslim from a different sect, because Allah swt already had chosen them as a Muslim.?ˇ I run little risk they will leave Islam completely unless Allah swt chooses so.?ˇ That other sect follower and I already agree on a lot of the basics but those little things are a huge rock in your path, which overtime you can crack at but its very difficult.
I believe in Allah swt and the straight path of my Prophet pbuh, thus its essential to help those guided onto the right road, and not the road that forks into obscurity.?ˇ Bringing the ummah (Muslim populace) into oneness has hope that in the future Muslims will be more unified, while new converts like myself are priceless to add to the faith its just a big risk to waste your time on something unknown.?ˇ While I do know that the brother/sister next to me believes in my faith but has some wrong habits, I find that much easier to help with better results.

What is the best company to open a LLC in Texas?	"So, we?õ????ve decided we need a LLC, and we want to know who to have it done. My suggestion is that you stop and consider that you could do it all yourself, painlessly on the Texas Secretary of State website. That would be easy. Would it be best? Maybe not.
There?õ????s a lot more to a LLC than just getting a charter from the state. Most of the services you will see on line do little more than what you could do at the Sec of State website.
Before you set up a legal entity, doesn?õ????t it make sense to get some legal advice? Of course it does! LLC?õ????s can be formed for many different purposes, and it if you don?õ????t have the right legal paperwork such as an operating agreement, you could be wasting your time.
Getting a charter from the state is the last step, not the first step in forming a LLC.
The first step is figuring out what you want to do, and why you need a LLC instead of a C Corp or S Corp or partnership. Then you need to figure out what kind of agreement you will have with your fellow LLC owners (and what follows is assuming that you will have co-owners). You need to consider what happens when things go bad, or good, or whatever.
You need to have s good set of written agreements which cover every possibility, including dissolution, dispute resolution, admitting new members(owners), booting out dissident members, choosing advisers, banking, making decisions, asking for money from owners, borrowing, lending, buying assets, etc., etc.
The charter you get from the state will address none of those things. No one should even think about going into business with someone else without something in writing covering those points. You need a good attorney. (Yes, it will cost money, and yes, it?õ????s possibly the best money you will ever spend)
Secondly, you need to figure out how this entity will be taxed. There are many alternatives, and you should see a CPA or EA about this. LLC?õ????s have a unique ability to select the method of taxation, and can either be taxed as a partnership, S-Corp or C-Corp, or in the case of a one-owner LLC, a disregarded entity. Again, you will spend some money, but it will easily be recaptured in tax savings by making the right choice.

How can the president limit the power of the judicial branch?	"Legally, the President of the USA may not limit the power of the judicial branch. The Constitution is the basis for all American laws, and the US Supreme Court is the final arbiter on what is or is not constitutional.
The only control the President has on the Supreme Court is the power to appoint judges to that court, with Congressional approval. Which means the current incumbent and the Republican Congress will be pushing for a conservative judge whose interpretation of the law is more to their liking.
That?õ????s what every President does, by the way.
Nonetheless, once a judge is confirmed to the US Supreme Court, it is a lifetime appointment. It is nearly impossible to remove a judge from the Supreme Court.
There is nothing the President can do.
This question is worrisome given that Donald Trump respects neither the Constitution nor the judicial system. And it is worrisome that some conservatives hate the judicial system when the Supreme Court does not rule in their favour.
Any attempt to give the White House power over the Supreme Court must be fought tooth and nail.

What does a cat's memory consist of?	"I?õ????ll just mention one thing. I?õ????ve found that all my cats have been excellent at remembering what their environment consists of, for example, the house they are living in. If I were to place any kind of object in my house that wasn?õ????t there before, my cats (or at least my curious young cat) will probably be checking it out within five minutes. Maybe they recognize that the smell of it is not exactly like what was in that part of the room before, but I think they have a good memory of what the layout was before I placed it there, i.e., their memory, at least some of their memory, is spatially oriented.
Here?õ????s a specific example: I purchased a boxed-up office chair and placed it temporarily in my living room. I have a few other boxes situated in various rooms around the house, and my cats seem to not give them any notice. But when I went and got my young cat Rougarou, and tried to place him on the new big box (because he likes being on top of things), he didn?õ????t want anything to do with it. He bolted off of it and exited to the second floor.
Another example: Four year?õ????s ago I inherited my old cat Bailey after my parents passed away. I brought the old cat into my house, but several days later she managed to run out the front door when I opened it. She was probably expecting to see an ?õ????outside?õ???ù that was the old neighborhood where my parents lived, instead she saw what was probably to her like an alien landscape. She was terrified. She ran down a deadend alley between two houses, and I tried to corral her, but she was too fast. She ran past me fast as a jackrabbit and right back to the front door, where I let her back in the house. This episode repeated itself a few days later, but since then, she has not tried to escape out the front door. She?õ????s replaced the old outside with the new outside in her spatial memory.

What is a hypothetical scenario where everyone dies with my level 100 Caterpie?	"You are going on a pleasant evening walk. Caterpie as usual, is in his Pokeball, hanging on your belt.
This kid had been stalking you for quite some time. He is an excited little Pokemon trainer who wants to become famous. He learns about other trainers- the famous ones, the strong ones, etc. Obviously he knows you- you have a level 100 Caterpie!
He thinks he can beat you easily and become famous. So he trains a Pidgey. He trains hard. He studies research papers on Bird type-versus-Bug type battles. He is very keen on defeating you. Today is the day- he decides. He stops you on your walk.
Kid- I wanna defeat your Caterpie. Today.
You know that kid?õ????s Pidgey will be no match to your powerful Caterpie. He is very young. You pity him for his foolishness. But he is very young, so you don?õ????t want to ruin his excitement.
You- Look here. There is no way you can beat a level 100 Pokemon right now. You need to learn more. You need to train more. Come back another day.
Kid- What?! You think a Caterpie will defeat a Pidgey! It?õ????s a WORM! Pidgey will finish it off in no time. And you think I can?õ????t defeat you?! You?õ????re a COWARD. You know you?õ????ll LOSE. You don?õ????t want to lose a kid, don?õ????t you?
Caterpie listens to all of this. It can?õ????t take it anymore. You and your Caterpie have bonded quite well over all the years you spent in training it all the way to level 100. You?õ????re Pokeball starts shaking.
Kid- Look at your Caterpie, it?õ????s trembling in fear!
You?õ????ve had enough. You?õ????re patience had been stretched to it?õ????s limits.
You- GO CATERPIE!
Kid- GO PIDGEY! GUST! NOW!
The kid was quick to move first.
But Caterpie knows to handle this. It manages to bury itself in the dust of the gust.
It?õ????s a neat trick you taught it. Now Caterpie is invisible and Pidgey is surprised.
You- STRINGSHOT, CATERPIE!
Out of nowhere the stringshot erupts and strangles Pidgey. Pidgey faints. The kid is devastated. He cries out loud. Loud enough that the a crowd gathers. The crowd starts accusing you. They call you immature for battling with a kid who has no experience in battling strong trainers. They call you names. Caterpie is enraged. It can?õ????t be quiet when it?õ????s trainer is humiliated.
It doesn?õ????t wait for your command.
It cocoons everyone with it?õ????s stringshot.
You know you?õ????re in trouble if you stay there. You call back Caterpie and get away from there.
News spreads about this like wildfire.
The Pokemon Police is searching for you for violating norms and causing damage to people using your Pokemon. The Trainer Control Squad has accused you of bad training. The League has decided to remove Caterpie from the Hall of Fame for bad conduct. Families of cocooned victims are searching for you to kill you with their Pokemon.
You try to escape but soon you are surrounded. A weird feeling of fear grips you. Caterpie senses that you are in trouble.
Pokemon charge at you from all sides. Charizards and Pidgeottos patrol the skies.
Venusaurs release their razor leaves. Raichus cause a thunder. Blastoises use their hydro pump. Caterpie evolves. Not into a Metapod, but into Butterfree. You act fast and give it the Buginium-Z. Butterfree uses protect so you can do something. You teach it infestation (TM 83).
You- Come on Caterpie! Oh sorry, Butterfree! Use Infestation with your Z-Power! Infestation (
NOTE: I don?õ????t know how exactly the Z-Power thing can be used as I have never played Gen 7. And my Charizard saves me.

What are some false assumptions about our life and this world that are created in our mind through the TV and Internet (especially social medias)?	"Very recently I was talking to a close friend of mine from school days after 3 months of no contact. He knows what I've and still been going through. So I told him jokingly, ?õ????you seem to be very busy with your new friends and work and all and so happy?õ???ù. He was like, ?õ????how do you know??õ???ù I told him that his Facebook profile and Instagram pictures reflect a lot of that. That's when he said, ?õ????It may look like I am having the best time of my life surrounded by friends all the time and partying and having fun right? No. I do my job, go to college, interact with the necessary people, laugh a little and come back. If I go through your social media now, I can sense your loneliness completely. Well that's because we know each other well but basically coming down to the point, everybody shows a happy picture on social media and in reality they have a life that is completely opposite to what it is.?õ???ù
You are leading a dual life- one that of social media life and the other that you're normally leading, the real one.
For TV, reality shows are a huge example. They portray something on camera and are basically something else off-camera. Celebrities fight and all but then they are all normal once the director says cut.
So the conclusion here is, everyone is going through something or another but still, put up that happy face in front of the camera!

Should other countries adopt Singapore's GRC system?	"It depends.
Firstly, GRCs are to some extent undemocratic. While in theory they exist to ensure minority representation in Parliament, what happens in practice is that the PAP (the ruling party) assigns one big-shot politician or ?õ????anchor minister?õ???ù to each GRC to ?õ????hold the fort?õ???ù, or as they say these days, to ?õ????carry?õ???ù that district. The remaining slots are filled with new faces that probably wouldn?õ????t have made it in on their own merit. In reality, GRCs are more of a ?õ????training grounds?õ???ù for young PAP politicians where they can learn the tools of the trade under the watchful eye of senior party members. Which is great for the party, but maybe not so much for the citizens.
Secondly, not all countries need minority representation. Many countries in the world today (Japan, South Korea, the Nordics, most of the European countries too) are extremely culturally and racially homogenous. Arguably there is no need for GRCs in those countries because the minority groups have all assimilated into the prevailing majority culture, and in Europe coalition governments are the norm anyway, which means even the smaller political parties can wield influence by teaming up with others.
The only country I can think of that could use such a system would be America, which does indeed have lots of minority subcultures that exist independently of the prevailing ?õ????white man?õ???ù culture. But America already has something like GRCs, because all the states send multiple representatives to the House, based on that state?õ????s population, and if any party chooses they could put a minority member in that group of representatives for that state. I think any attempt to require that delegations contain minority members would be seen by Americans as another attempt at playing the ?õ????race card?õ???ù.
Anyway, America has far bigger problems than lack of minority representation - the lack of third-party options and the first-past-the-post voting system both contribute to an entrenched two-party power system which started out alright but has since devolved into petty partisan squabbling. In addition to that there?õ????s the voter apathy, gerrymandering, filibustering, etc. The fact that Americans increasingly belong to two distinct self-reinforcing media bubbles also means they are unlikely to ever agree on cooperation.
So, to sum up: GRCs are in theory a good idea, in practice have too much potential for abuse. They are also not generally appropriate to most modern democracies, and the only country I can think of that could use them already has something similar in place.
So: no. The GRC system is a peculiarity of the Singaporean political system, that suits our unique socio-politic circumstances. Attempting to transplant this system elsewhere without understanding why it works is unwise.

"It is simply a system (something like hedging), formula (including a framework with multiple variables and metrics), timing/decision point, and/or weighting methodology to deliver outperformance.

The simplest example I can think of in terms of portfolio management alpha would be the choice to equally weight the S&P500 instead of market cap weighting it. You have made a decision on the portfolio that delivers (if positive) outperformance.

What is the half of 1.25?	"1.25/2 = (125/2)?ü??1/100
Now, we can easily solve it.
But, I would like to share a different method.
As we know,
You can easily understand it, consider 28/4
Keep forming groups of four till you have none left.
28 - 4-4-4-4-4-4-4 =0
This is
The number of groups formed is 7.
So, that's our answer 28/4 = 7.
So, we have to solve 125/2.
125-2-2-2?õ?????õ????-2- 0.5?ü??2 =0
125-(2+2+2+2?õ????.+ 0.5?ü??2) =0
As, we can see that 2 will come 62 times complete and a half time.( 62?ü??2=124 and 0.5?ü??2=1)
125- 2?ü??62- 2?ü??.5=0
125- 2(62+.5)=0
125- 2?ü??62.5=0
So, the number of groups formed are 62.5
Therefore,
125/2= 62.5
1.25/2 = (125/2)?ü??1/100
=62.5/100
=0.625
So, our answer would be
1.25/2 =0.625
I hope that, my solution gave you a new approach to see the problems of this category.

Why do teenagers these days act so mature on Quora while in reality they are not?	"This isn?õ????t saying that ALL teenagers on Quora are immature in real life and are hiding their immaturity from Quora, but if a teenager acts mature on Quora when they appear to be immature (or at least not as mature as they appear on Quora) in real life, it?õ????s probably because acting immature is unnecessary and unwanted when answering most questions (not just on Quora, but everywhere), and on a website like Quora, can even result in punishments adequate for the immaturity demonstrated.
This doesn?õ????t mean that you need to answer every question with a stone-faced, serious impression every single time; some people have answered questions with a certain tone that implies a more relaxed nature to the question, and it has proven to sometimes be as effective as, if not even more effective than, a more serious answer.
On Quora, you and every child, teenager, and adult on Quora needs to regulate the times in which you probably should be formal with your answers, and when being a bit relaxed, or more strongly put, ?õ????immature?õ???ù, may be okay or even preferred over non-formal answers.
If a question requires serious, thought-out answers for you not to come off as a misinformed or mean-spirited person to Quora?õ????s general audience, you?õ????d be most fortunately treated by answering the question seriously and adequately, but correctly. Meanwhile, if the question appears to be one that may require a serious answer to truly express the correct response to the question, but won?õ????t pass you off as a misinformed person if you answer a bit informally, then you can comfortably spice up your answers a bit. I?õ????d assume this also applies with teenager Quorans, because, well, they?õ????re Quorans too, and they need to follow the same guidelines that anyone else on Quora does.
Overall, don?õ????t make the assumption that every teenage Quoran on the Internet is some immature brat in disguise of a mature being, or even that ANY teenage Quoran could fit under the category. However, if they answer the question in a more formal way than they would if, say, you confronted them in real life and asked them the question, it?õ????s because answering questions usually requires some form of maturity, and even if it doesn?õ????t, Quora has strict guidelines to put immature joke answers at the bottom of its projected feeds.

How did the Ancient Chinese do mathematic problems? How does it compare to today's methods?	"Here are two examples of basic mathematics education in the early period of the Chinese history. They are all provided by archeological explore.
In modern China, multiplication table is one of the most important tool for math education of young children.

Before paper was invented, ancient Chinese used to wrote on bamboo slips and silk, the government officials in the period of warring states and Qin, Han dynasties especially loved to write documents on bamboo and wooden slips. Among the 30000 slips found in Liye, around 15000 pieces were carrying ancient Chinese caracters, most of them were government documents. However, one piece of wooden slips was a little different.
This is a multiplication table of Qin dynasty. It contents multiplication formula between every two units, nearly the same as the one we use today.

Why is 40 hours the amount of time needed in the cockpit to become a private pilot?	"In the US the FAA requires this as the minimum amount of training time. I?õ????m not sure how the was set originally, that?õ????s been the rule for some decades now. In practice, people usually take more time than that: 60?õ????80 hours, and I?õ????ve heard of 100 hours.
In flight training you need to learn three broad things: 1) how to control the plane and what to do if things go wrong, 2) weather and the environment of flight, 3) how to operate ?õ????in the system?õ???ù, i.e. talk on the radio, approach an unfamiliar airport, etc.
A long time ago flight training was more the #1 and #2. And we didn?õ????t know that much about weather either. We know more about weather, and #3 has gotten a larger proportion. There?õ????s more people flying, the system of ATC, airports, air routes, airspace, etc has had to become more complex. So it takes longer to learn.
So the average amount of time to reach the standards necessary to be a pilot has been slowly moving up.

What is unique about Gandhian nationalism?	"It's going to sound crazy but it's not as unique as you think. This answer will not be long like others that will answer. When people exploit a nation, people go along with it. Eventually, there is a uprising. Right? The uniqueness isn't that surprising. It was more of the non-violent approach but it lead into a sense of nationalism that exists in India today. I never been to India but I know that Ghandian nationalism has done it's job. I won't go into useless theory and detail. Understand that today, Ghandhi is God in India and that is the truth.
I hope that helps.

Who was first to the moon: Americans or the Nazis?	"The Americans are the first and only nation to land on the moon but there is a conspiracy theory that the Germans established a base on the dark side of the moon and Hitler made his escape to it.

In my extensive research of dissident American theories about the physical conditions on the Moon I have proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that there is atmosphere, water and vegetation on the Moon, and that man does not need a space suit to walk on the Moon.
A pair of jeans, a pullover and sneakers are just about enough. Everything NASA has told the world about the Moon is a lie and it was done to keep the exclusivity of the club from joinings by the third world countries. All these physical conditions make it a lot more easier to build a Moon base.

Which would be more effective in knocking a bear down - a rubber bullet or a lead bullet with the same momentum?	"You have a misconception. The momentum of the bullet is not what knocks down the bear. If it did, the equal and opposite momentum of the recoil would knock you down a lot harder, because you weigh less than the bear. What knocks the bear down (assuming it does) is the damage the bullet does to the bear?õ????s anatomy. For that, lead will be

What will the next ISS be like?	"Well you didn?õ????t say what you mean by the ?õ????next ISS?õ???ù. If you mean the next big international space station in LEO, there are no plans at present. But if you mean by this the next big international space project, then I think the ESA village is the best bet for the next one.
It will probably be at the Moon?õ????s north or south pole, at one of the ?õ????peaks of almost eternal light?õ???ù next to craters of almost eternal darkness. The sun will skim around the horizon, and be visible 24/7 nearly all the year round. Temperature near constant. Heat rejection is easy because anything flat on the surface never gets any sunlight on it. Solar power can be collected by a vertical panel that rotates once a month - or mirrors can reflect it to a rover or panel that needs it. They would explore the ice that probably has collected in permanently shadowed regions around the poles. Other missions to the Moon could explore the probably vast lunar caves.
It would be like the ISS but called a ?õ????village?õ???ù because you can have many habitats in a small geographical region, either physically connected or close by. Both China and Russia want to be involved in it. The US is the only major space faring country that isn?õ????t interested at present.
The habitats could share facilities or have separate facilities. Even if some of them are are just close enough to each other to offer help in an emergency, there are obvious benefits in proximity somewhere as hostile as the vacuum of the Moon.
ESA are the ones who are promoting it at present. I think it should be very interesting and the format of a ?õ????village?õ???ù allows a much more flexible approach than the ISS.
I think we are bound to continue to have space stations of some sort for humans in LEO. But they don?õ????t need to be as large as the ISS. China will surely continue with its space stations in LEO, and I?õ????d have thought there?õ????d be some value in habitats in LEO and probably at L1 / L2 as part of the plans to explore the Moon. I think, though nobody is actually planning this, that it would be useful to have some sort of space station in LEO to experiment with artificial gravity and closed systems for space habitats, growing their food etc, with artificial gravity through spinning, perhaps using a tether system. This could be a much smaller, lower cost facility than the ISS. So far there have been no experiments in artificial gravity at all applied to humans.
Also, by the mid 2020s it might be that we get Skylon flying into space regularly, perhaps costs of rocket launches go right down and so on.
Those though are conjectures. The ESA village I think is the only currently planned international space project that is at a stage where it looks like it might actually happen. I think myself that it?õ????s a shame that NASA are not interested in joining in though they may well get involved in a station at L1. Trump has canceled the asteroid redirect mission and his space plan has no goal at all in the Earth Moon system outside of LEO as far as I know. The Moon is the obvious and closest place to visit and hardly explored. Perhaps his administration may eventually get interested in a return to the Moon.
Whether or not, I think by the mid 2020s all the other space faring nations probably will join in building a lunar village. And we?õ????ll see what the US does when that happens. I can?õ????t see everyone joining in sending humans to Mars myself. Not at this stage, though that is what the US wants them to do.

Does praying actually work?	"Have you ever heard about Nazhil Valitov?
Professor of Bashkiria University (Russia) Nazhip Valitov is a world-renowned chemist. He used to be quite far from theology and deal with science-related issues solely.
The work is now available at 45 scientific libraries and 12 countries of the world, including the US, Great Britain, France, Japan. A unique feature of this monograph consists in the ability of Valitov to prove using strict formulas that all objects in the Universe interact with one another instantly, irrespective of the distance between them.
It used to be considered no interaction is possible at the speed exceeding that of light. This fact, according to the professor himself, tells about the existence of a certain one supreme force in the Universe.
In the ancient Indian religious texts, dating back to 8 thousand years ago, scientifically explained that the Lord is full of inconceivable energies. He can perceive our activity in any form and has the ability to transform His various energies at His will.

How can I get cheaper prices at a pawn shop?	"It's not easy to do. Pawn shops are in business to make money and they know that in most cases someone will pay what they're asking. There may be a little wiggle room but they won't go down by much. If you're trying to get more than 10% off you're probably on a fools errand. And even then it's going to depend on a number of factors like how long it's been sitting there, who you're talking to (employee or owner), changes in value since it was priced.
So gold jewelry and the price of gold has been rising? Nope. Old TV (like pre flat screen), they may pay you to haul it away (not really, but you get it right?).
If you're really looking for good deals you can't do much better than private party. Unless you can't or don't trust the authenticity of the item (again jewelry, or?õ???? a firearm?) you'll always get a better deal private party. Think of it this way, if you're looking at a $100 item, the shop probably paid $25?õ????40 for it, maybe less. So if you get them to drop to $90 who's the sucker?
Garage/yard sales are the best for bargains. Next would be Craigslist or local classified ads. Next swap meets and flea markets. Consignment stores. Lastly estate sales (wait for the last hour of the last day).
Pawn shops are last resort.
Remember, they have overhead to cover so even though they would still make money if they sold that $100 item for $50, there's not enough margin in that to cover their operating expenses, never mind make a profit.
Oh, and be wary of electronic items from pawn shops, you wouldn't believe how many of those items come with a bonus roach infestation. Wish I was kidding about that but I've seen it too many times.
Happy bargain hunting!

The other Gods, considered to be somewhat lesser Gods on a lower scale are traced somehow to these 3.
On the other side, the Geographic locations of these 3, Bramha, Vishnu and Shiva are specifically documented historically. They are supposed to have a specific location here on earth when they used to reside here and have a more permanant address in another star system, suspected to be outside our galaxy.

Is 'he'd had' correct in this sentence?		
What does it mean when a stray cat keeps walking into my house?	"When I first saw your question (without details you added), I thought of writing: It means you've left your door open! ;)
But with the details you've added, I'd say the cat has every intention of adopting you and moving in. Animals can 'read' people better than most people can. Not to say that they're always right and don't make poor judgement calls just like people, but this cat seems to have decided you'd make a great owner. Even if you haven't noticed the cat before, it's probably watched you for a while.
Do you know your neighbours and if any have a cat? It's a good idea to snap a photo of the cat on your phone and then knock on your neigbours' doors and ask them if they've lost a cat or know anyone near by has. With your phone, you can show them the cat for them to check. Mind you, this depends on what your neighbourhood is like and whether there are any seedy disreputable places you might not feel safe knocking on their door (since you're anonymous and I've no idea your sex or age). Play it by ear.
On the other hand, it might just be a very friendly sociable cat who likes everyone. Some cats are like that. They'd be happy living in multiple homes around the neighbourhood and do their best to make themselves welcome wherever. You'll quickly find if that's true if you ask about.
Since you say the cat is friendly and just 'waltzes in,' it doesn't sound like a cat with rabies. But he might have fleas and you don't want to deal with that.

Owning a firearm in the United States is associated with increased risk of suicide. Is it the same in countries with stronger gun laws?	"It may happen but I?õ????ve never heard of a single person who said to themselves. Gee, I?õ????m so depressed and despondent, everything is so bad I think I?õ????ll commit suicide, no wait, I don?õ????t have a gun so I?õ????ll just suck it up and get better.
I had a really good friend that committed suicide with a gun many years ago. His ex wife blamed me for having encouraged him into shooting sports by taking him to the range, and talking guns with him from time to time. I blamed myself for the same reasons for a long time. I wasn?õ????t the cause of his depression, drug dependency, business problems or his failed marriage, but I had encouraged his interest in firearms. I finally ran into a mutual friend several years later that he had been sharing a house with right before his death who told me everything leading up to it, and gave me a reason to stop blaming myself for being a part of this. I won?õ????t go into everything but he had already tried poison, several drug overdoses, and drunk driving (he had nearly killed himself and others), before finally killing himself with his Grandfathers WWII souvenir rifle that had laid untouched in his parents attic since before he was born. His suicide was as related to his interest in guns as it was to his being a licensed Pharmacist or a licensed driver. His own bad decisions, spiraling out of control lifestyle, and other factors were the why, the gun only the final how. He was my friend and I will always miss him, but I no longer blame myself anymore than I do his Grandpaws rifle.
I think that?õ????s often the thing about suicides, the gun may be the how but it is rarely the why. Where there is a strong will there is always a way that will be sought and found.

"How does ""inception"" relate to ""dream within a dream"" when its literal meaning is ""beginning or birth""?"	"It don?õ????t think it relates specifically to a dream within a dream.
I believe the title of the movie refers in a general sense to the fact that peoples minds give birth to dreams and ideas. In the movie, inception is used as a term to describe the planting of an idea in someone's mind through dreamsharing and making them think it is their own.
A title is often chosen to emphasize the theme of a movie. In this case, I think the story revolves around the fact that the wife of the main character originates the idea that their world might not be the real world. Once that thought is given birth to, it is there. You can?õ????t unplant the seed. The same seed of doubt is continually present in the main character, and I presume, the viewer.

So how do you get my hackles up? Unsafe lab behavior. I tell my students on day 1:
?õ????I'm flexible with all of the rules, provided you have a good reason. Late but had a bathroom issue? Forget it. Homework is missing but there's a good reason? No penalty. Think there should be an exception? Ask, I'll probably agree. But be unsafe in the lab?
I will fail you. And then, I will wait. Wait until you are grown and have children, get a job in their school, and fail them, too.
NO ONE gets hurt in my classroom. We clear??õ???ù
This usually gets a laugh, and that's the point. I want them to know that injury and death can and do happen in chemistry classes, but not mine. We are safety obsessed. Occasionally I have to remind them of this, but usually it's only the one time that does the trick.
20 years of teaching lab, and I had a student cut herself once. She needed a BandAid. Otherwise (knocks on skull) no accidents.
And yeah, some kids drive me batty. But then I wasn't all that stable to begin with. Do I dislike those kids? Sometimes. But I try to remember they are kids, and they come with their own issues. I take deep breaths, and get back to work. And I try to help them more, because maybe they need more. Maybe that's why they're being jerks to me. Maybe they just need a little nudge.
It doesn't usually work - most kids that are jerks to me in September are jerks to me in June. But a few I've turned around.

"Can SVT, AT, or VT medicine cause weight loss?"	"Anything is possible, since all patients react to medications differently.
Some cardiac medications can cause nausea, which could be an indirect cause of weight loss.
A much more common complaint is that many cardiac meds cause fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance.
If you suspect a cardiac medication is causing such symptoms, you should have a frank discussion with your cardiologist. There are often alternative medications that can be tried. Some patients will respond better to one medication than another.
Never stop a cardiac?õ????or any other prescribed medication?õ????without discussing it with your cardiologist or medical provider first. Doing so could be dangerous.

Are there reptile species that are led by a dominant female member?	"No. The reason why is actually pretty simple - there are only a handful of reptile species that are social at all. Crocodilians are the most notable (and they are more closely related to dinosaurs/birds than they are to other reptiles, in any case). Large male crocodilians defend their territory from other males, and welcome females to inhabit it. I?õ????m not sure this counts as being dominant over the females, though.
Solomon Island skinks (Corucia zebrata) live in family groups, but the male seems to exhibit the most dominant behavior, according to the observations of keepers (herding the females and keeping the group together). Females with new young can be aggressive, though.
I?õ????m unaware of any other reptiles that live in social groups at all. Typically, in lizards, males are territorial, and females go where they feel like going. In snakes, males wander to find females during the breeding season. In most snakes, males are smaller than females.

What is meant by inflation?	"Infltion simply means the increase in price of a product over a period of time say a month or a quarter or a year as the case may be. Inflation in other sense is the extra amount which you pay for a particular good after a period of time.
Inflation is bascically of 2 types of goods - Consumer Goods and Wholeseller Goods, and Comsumer Goods inflation is calculated using CPI (Consumer Price Index ) and Wholeseller Gods inflation is calculated using WPI (Wholesale Price Index).
Many economists beleive that inflation is good for the economy when there is unused labor or resources, inflation theoretically helps increase production. Famous British economist John Maynard Keynes believed that some inflation was necessary to prevent the ""Paradox of Thrift."" If consumer prices are allowed to fall consistently because the country is becoming too productive, consumers learn to hold off their purchases to wait for a better deal. The net effect of this paradox is to reduce aggregate demand, leading to less production, layoffs and a faltering economy.
ALl these are theoritical point of view. Possible benefit of inflation differs from economy to economy. For some it is a boon and for some it is a curse. That is why Goverment and Central Bank of a country tries their best to keep the inflation at a suitable level as some sort of inflation is necesary for the economy as a whole.

Should I stop gaming in order to get fit and better grades as a teenager?	"I stopped gaming on January 17, 2017, approximately one month before my 14th birthday.
At the time, I had been gaming for 5 years. It literally sucked up my social life, school, and everything in between. As a kid, I lost a lot of time to gaming. It was basically what I lived for, and it's something I'll forever regret. But, I decided to make a change.
I quit cold turkey. I packed up all of my gaming equipment save for my laptop which I got a month earlier; I still use the laptop for schoolwork, but not for gaming.
In addition, I started working out, I've been eating healthy. I rarely eat any processed foods or anything with gmos, unless when absolutely neccesary.
Well, in the short span of those three months, I've gained a six packs, developed more muscles, lost the urge to game for the most part, and my grades have risen. I've, both physically and mentally, never felt better. My relationship with my family is much better, I have more friends at school. My grades have risen to almost all A?õ????s.
I've also taken up new hobbies such as parkour and outdoors activities. I'm currently in the process of building a greenhouse.
So yes, you should stop gaming and become fit.

Why doesn't the government kill all psychopaths?	"Your church and its unique interpretation of the scriptures is not the judge, jury and executioner for all Americans - not does it supersede constitutional civil rights. In fact, it flies in the face of religious and civil liberties law.?ˇ By the way, I live in Charleston and my family attended the ?õ????white?õ???ù church next door to Mother Emanuel - the ?õ????black church?õ???ù - where nine people were massacred - for six generations. I was the sixth generation Southern Baptist baptized in the same vestibule.
There is absolutely no bio-marker, forensic evidence, or etiology for any psychological or psychiatric disorder of any kind. The approach suggested in this question is not only unconstitutional, but it also places the judicial power to decide who lives or dies in the hands of a brutal and fraudulent group of pseudo-scientists, commonly known as shrinks. People?õ????s constitutional rights should never be based on a psychiatric DIAGNOSIS, given their absurd subjectivity, and the corrupt, strange bedfellow-complicity between shrinks and the courts. If psychiatry is the religion of the judicial system, then psychiatrists have become our new priests.
Ultimately, based on your premise, they would make the decision about who lives and dies. If you agree with the death penalty, (and I do not), you should at least accept that its administration should be rooted in patterns of BEHAVIOR. To coin an old phrase, you cannot hang a horse thief until he steals the horse.
However, it has not stopped certain courts from trying. Are you also opposed to abortion? If you do - there here?õ????s a good example of how such thinking would backfire on your belief system:
So how is that for violating religious liberties that I imagine you cherish and want to protect based on your question? You cannot kill a ?õ????psychopath?õ???ù until he commits a murder or violent crime.
Besides, we live in a society where most people do not know the difference between someone ?õ????psychotic?õ???ù (out of touch with reality) and a ?õ????psychopath?õ???ù (someone void of empathy, antisocial and prone to violent crime). Most people do not know the difference between a ?õ????psychiatrist?õ???ù and a ?õ????psychologist.?õ???ù Most people cannot distinguish between ?õ????unipolar?õ???ù and ?õ????bipolar?õ???ù depression. So these decisions are hardly a matter to place in the hands of most politicians, juries or judges.
Rather, we live in a country where the ?õ????paranoid schizophrenic?õ???ù - everyone?õ????s favorite scapegoat - is stereotyped in the media as responsible for all mass murders - while
I do not, but that was not the question.
The question seems to be - why don?õ????t we, like the Nazis, euthanize those who MIGHT pose a threat to society at large, based on a cluster of subjective criteria that predicts certain types of behaviors before the crime is committed. The answer is simple: Because it?õ????s violates basic due process and the fundamental of constitutional law, including freedom of religion, as noted above. It also empowers psychiatrists who have already infiltrated and become the priests of the judicial system, something they consciously accomplished?ˇ in the absence of medical credibility.

To be fair, I have no idea if the Massachusetts tests and renewals are actually a higher bar than Texas. But if they are, I wouldn't blame them. It can be tough driving here.

Why might one learn German?	"I speak several languages - a few fluently. One of them is German.
Let's take the efficiency of German first. German will change the way you think about language moreso than French or Spanish (which is always a slightly disingenuous comparison since they are distinctly different language families). German is regular and highly consistent compared to other Romance languages or even other Germanic languages such as English. Pronunciation is easier to learn and easier to suss out when confronted with new words. Germans make liberal use of compound words for advanced subjects that make growing your vocab decidedly more straightforward. Take, for example, the word Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung. It looks like a mouthful. It means speed limit. But breaking it down slightly, -keit- is like -ness or -ment for abstract nouns. Be- and ge- are action prefixes like we have pre-, post-, on-, etc. -grenz- comes from Grenze meaning border or edge or limit in this case. And -ung is another of those abstract nouns suffixes. Compared to French or even English, German is a compact language of linguistic efficiency. Read a sentence of French and you will notice lots of smaller word constructions that contribute to French being, on average, 30% longer than English to speak or write. This is a translation industry standard I have worked with. Although Mark Twain was right that some German sentences can start when a train leaves a station and it will be finished only after the caboose has passed by and can be confusing because of verb placements, it is honestly a relatively minor complaint in the scheme of things. Yes, the declined articles do take some getting used to but, when comparing to other languages, every language save a very few have gendered articles that have some type of declension, at least when used as direct objects as is the case in French. Look up the difference between the use of ""y"" and ""en"" for direct object ""it"" in French. Add to that things like every noun in German is capitalized (like English used to be -- look at our Declaration of Independence in the US) and every adjective has certain possible endings as well as some other things and learning new German on your own becomes moderately easier to look up.
Let's look at history and use opportunities. As pointed out by
Germany has a lively and first-class press of nearly every stripe. German press tend to be more thoughtful and less reactionary on the whole. There are always exceptions. Also, if you want to work in Germany, you have to speak German at a certifiable level. This is why many people in Spain are learning German, so they can take advantage of the current IT visa program that Germany has setup to attract outside IT talent while they work to fill that skill gap domestically. Germany has industry in every part of the world, products in every part of the world and people learning German everywhere. It's not at the rate of English, French, Spanish or Chinese but they have a great reputation and they have redefined what Deutschland uber alles means. I once had a very enjoyable discussion in German with a Saudi when I lived in Qatar before I knew Arabic.
In addition, the high quality resources for learning and practicing German are much more available for free or very reduced costs. Deutsche Welle, the German radio brand (like NPR in the States), has a specific mission to educate people worldwide in German language and culture. (EDIT: As was pointed out in the comments by
Lastly, it is damned impressive to people when you can speak it well. It is shrouded in a mystery of confusion and difficulty that I have never found to be true except at the very earliest stages. I have twice heard in my presence, 'This is Greg, the guy I was telling you about. He speaks French but he also speaks German.' And the other person will be surprised and then even more surprised if they actually speak it. We get a lot more support as Americans when we speak a foreign language because, truly, it is too rare. But the support and admiration you get with German is off the charts compared to telling someone you speak Spanish or French or other European languages. Chinese really beats German in that department but I don't recommend learning Chinese as your first language if you're not sure of German.
I am very biased as German was my first language and love. I spent a good deal of time in Germany and I probably conflate my personal experiences with my assessment of German. But I stand by it. I hope you enjoy learning it but don't be afraid to drop it if it doesn't work out. Go to another language if you want. She'll always be here and sometimes your second lover is your sweetest because you learned a lot from your first one. ;)
EDIT: I made a small edit to clarify my meaning.

I am currently reading the novel ?õ????Where the Red Fern Grows?õ???ù. In it, a impoverished, rural 11 year old boy longs to own two coon hounds. The cost of which represents a near impossible hurtle for someone in his position to overcome. His parents are too poor to help out so he decides he?õ????s going to earn the money himself. He picks blackberries barefooted, sells vegetables and bait to fishermen, sells pelts at the general store, anything he can think of to earn a few pennies. His passion and determination see him through and he eventually achieves his dream. It takes him two years.
Beyond the ethical implications against software piracy, I?õ????d like to appeal to what I hope is your goal: to produce the best music you can make. May I suggest that

"Why are the youth of Kashmir going for terrorism, which leads to their meaningless death, instead on focussing on their studies?"	"The Kashmiri youth is being fooled by people like Asiya Andrabi, Yasin Malik and Syed Ali Geelani. They have been convinced that the INDIAN union is against them. This was all the doing of ISI. All the 3 are ISI sympathisers.
They have wasted their time, energy and resources in this meaningless stone pelting and terror acts. I would like to ask these guys, what did you gain from all this? You shut your own state down and probably cost the state some lakhs of rupees if not crores in this dumb protest of killing a damn terrorist. Burning your own house down just because you are angry isn't wise. There's no point in blaming the INDIAN forces if you have destroyed the state by yourself.
Coming back to the point, the youth there has been brainwashed by Pak agents and have been handed weapons to fight some war for independence. I think even the killing of Burhan Wani had a hand of ISI to spark this entire situation in Kashmir. The youth there must be quiet dumb to agree to everything these Pakistani scoundrels tell them. The youth has also been convinced in believing that pelting stones at the security forces makes them a freedom fighter.
I don't mean to hurt any religious sentiments, but the Pak agents there are just using the name of Quran to just incite violence there. I can't believe that these guys call themselves Muslims. All this crackdown in the valley created a perfect atmosphere for the youth to join terrorism. The call for ?õ????bandhs?õ???? in the valley generated enough unemployment that the idiots there are ready to pickup weapons. If all the Kashmiris had stood together against the Pak agents, all this could have been prevented.

Will clients be always ok with putting their website in your portfolio? And should you always ask them first?	"Depending on the law you are bound to (country, etc.) you have some rights to the work you do. In many cases intellectual rights are yours forever and a client pay you for using your work commercially, modify, resell etc.
Even if intellectual rights are yours, in some cases you cannot openly show some results or details with a world without e.g. written agreement of a client. Example is Non disclosure Agreement (NDA) or just when a client state it clearly in work agreement.
Of course it is wise to count it as an additional cost to you. The less you can show in portfolio the harder it will be to get new clients.
Whether you should ask about that first depends on how important is to you to put something new to a portfolio. Maybe you are ok doing it as a ghost-developer, undercover, but for better money.

How should I change mind blocking patterns?	"The mind - which is all mental activities - is like a cup of water. The mental activities that are distracting or lead to unwise behaviors are dirt in the water.

How are stairs designed?	"Stairs are designed in plan and in section at the same time.
I design stairs by giving 42?õ???? width for each run, plus 11?õ???? for each tread. There are ways to make them smaller that I may employ later in the design process, but to make sure everything will fit properly that is where I start. Then I put a 6?õ???? wide wall between runs of stairs if there is a switchback. It will probably end up being more like 4?õ???? wide, but again, I leave extra room to take out later.
In section I draw the stairs to make sure there is enough head height. My codes require a minimum of 80?õ???? of clear headroom from the nose of each tread, so I need to make sure that if I have an overhanging floor above I have left enough room for a legal stair to be constructed.
To draw the runs of stairs, I measure the height from the floor to each landing (usually one landing, because most of the time I draw a two-flight switchback stair). I then divide that height by either 7 or 7.75 (the latter only for single-family residential) and round up to get the number of treads I need. I use the DIV command in AutoCAD to evenly divide the distance into my individual riser heights. Then I draw out my stair in rough blocks ?õ???? even if the final stair looks very different I always start with a simple stair that is just the rise and run of the treads.
My codes require that stringers be at least 6?õ???? deep when made of wood, so I draw the thickness of that part of the stair at 8?õ???? ?õ???? I add a little extra so there are no pinch points.
Then I draw in the clear head space above each run of stairs, and make sure that it works in both plan and elevation.
All stairs will need at least one handrail and probably a guardrail, depending on the type of building. I locate those and draw them into the plan, then put rough blockouts for them into the section as well.
After we?õ????ve figured out how much space the stairs will take up, we can do aesthetic design, determining what the risers and treads look like and what type of guardrail and handrail we want to use. Sometimes the shape of the stairs will preclude one or another design choice, but we know that upfront because we put the work into blocking out the shape of the stairs from the start.

Someone is holding a gun to your head. They ask you your religion. What do you say?	"I have had this experience. In the Republic of South Sudan, I was grasped by a boorish bureaucrat and his AK47-wielding guard when word had gotten around I was a journalist. (There had been a crackdown on foreign journalists in the country?õ???? still is a crackdown, actually?õ???? and my visa didn?õ????t mention anything about journalism.)
A friend had grabbed me to take me to the Rumbek Cultural Center for some sort of concert/demonstration. Needless to say, I wasn?õ????t supposed to be there. And, people were suspicious of the American journalist.
This pudgy figure was doubly suspicious. ?õ????Why are you here??õ???ù;?õ????What is your goal??õ???ù; etc.
Thankfully, my friend was a smooth enough talker to keep us from any of the darker paths that situation could have easily taken. But, before we could take off, he asked, ?õ????Are you a Christian??õ???ù
I said yes before I even realized what he had asked. (Years spent in religious areas, and suffering countless proselytization efforts, had, apparently, made this my reflexive response)
South Sudan, for those unaware, is a nominally Christian country in a decisively non-Christian area. American fundamentalists played a disproportionate role in the US?õ???? decision to back the country?õ????s separation from Sudan (a Muslim country). But religion has cleaved South Sudan from its neighbors since the British occupied the area, though it is not the only factor to do so. Extremists still cross these borders to kidnap and enslave people for at least pseudo-religious reasons (it can be damn hard to sort out ideological and economic motives in cases like these, but I think religion gets at least part of the blame).
Perhaps next time I?õ????ll answer honestly ?õ?????õ????No.?õ???ù?õ???? and see what happens. Then again, that would be a bit ballsy and anarchic.

As an 'atheist' do you feel that you have been labeled 'a nonconformist' by the lunatics running the asylum?	"As an 'atheist' do you feel that you have been labeled 'a nonconformist' by the lunatics running the asylum?
In my life I have been told by theists more times than I can count that there is a god, that I should believe it, and very often that I will burn in hell for all eternity. Considering that they never offer a single shred of concrete evidence to back up any of their extraordinary claims, yes, I do agree that the inmates appear to be in charge of the asylum.
Then there's also the fact that throughout most of human history admitting to not believing in a particular deity could be a death sentence. In some counties, even today, confessing to being an atheist is extremely dangerous.
I believe that one big reason that so many believe is that they follow the majority. Should atheists even become the majority, I think that a tipping point might be reached where atheists very quickly become a much bigger majority.
Conformity, when it makes sense, is usually a good thing. However, conformity simple to follow the crowd can be a recipe for disaster.

What made Donald Trump's victory so unexpected?	"A few reasons. The biggest one was the polls.
People criticised Nate Silver for giving Trump a 30% chance of winning on election night, believing his odds were much lower.
A few nights before the election there was also an increased turnout in the Hispanic vote in early voting. Conventional wisdom was that they would vote for Hillary Clinton in similar numbers to Obama, so they would flip Florida and Nevada (Nevada turned out true, but it wasn't enough to actually make Trump lose).
People predicted it was possible for Trump to win, but the general idea was:
New Hampshire, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Nevada, Colorado and then one vote from Maine. Conventional wisdom was that Trump had to carry ALL of these states. Clinton only had to win one.
Because of this, the Clinton campaign focused on the African American and Hispanic vote in North Carolina and Florida, and thought the Hispanic backlash to Trump would be so strong that they were campaigning in Arizona.
For months there was a claim running around in right wing circles that support for Trump was higher than the polls were showing, because Trump supporters or potential Trump voters were ashamed to admit it. These claims were generally derided as unfounded and with no evidence, when on Election Day they turned out to be true.
The rustbelt was a major upset which no one relying on data predicted. The only people who predicted it were Michael Moore (not relying on any data) and a few Trump pundits looking at weird subjective metrics like the number of pro Trump posters vs pro Clinton.
In the end, the swing states did not matter that much because of the rust belt. Trump could have lost Florida, New Hampshire North Carolina, and Nevada and still won because of the rust belt.

How long will a warrant for petty theft stay active before the courts just drop the entire thing?	"I?õ????ve seen 20+ year old warrants for minor charges such as failure to appear for a speeding ticket. The warrants just kind of sit in a file cabinet drawer and are forgotten, but they are still there. In order for the warrant to be dropped by the court system it requires the state?õ????s attorney to have the circuit clerk to find the file and bring it before the judge. The state?õ????s attorney will ask the judge to dismiss the charge. The judge dismisses it, makes appropriate notes in the warrant file. The state?õ????s attorney makes appropriate notes. The information dropping the warrant is sent to the sheriff?õ????s office and they have to get the warrant taken out of the system, do whatever processing they have to do and return the warrant to the circuit clerks office who again has to deal with it. Since all these people are overworked and it is much less work to just ignore the warrant, then no one ever goes to the trouble of expunging old warrants. But if the person who has the warrant on them gets pulled over in a traffic stop then that 20 year old warrant will cause the person to be arrested.
In order to clear the warrant then I would suggest calling the state?õ????s attorney?õ????s office where the warrant was issued. Do it over the phone because if you go in person then you can expect to be arrested.

Are there any young Italians who still practice Catholicism?	"Yes. At least in my parish (diocese of Concordia-Pordenone, North-Eastern Italy).
It depends on your definition of ?õ????young?õ???ù. I am 34 and I attend mass almost every Sunday. You can discuss if this counts as ?õ????practice?õ???ù, but don?õ????t you dare tell me I am not young! :D
Jokes aside, church attendance is pretty high until junior high school (around 50%, I would say), then drops sharply. I think only one every 15?õ????20 churchgoers are teenagers. The strongest groups are young children, mothers of young children, and grand-mothers of young children, pretty much like at the playground. There are some exceptions, though: young fathers (like myself), boy-scouts, choir members, etc.
This is just a rough guesstimate based on my experience. Typically, I?õ????d say adolescents do not care about religion very much. Even if they care, they are frequently unaware or mindless or critical of some aspects of the Catholic doctrine. In some parishes, there are activities specifically targeted to young people, which despite the good effort are not really successful at increasing church attendance.
But there are exceptions. So the answer is yes: some young Italians are practising Catholic. Not

This is what happens when you don't shave your pubic hairs and thats the reason it's also called as a PUBIC LICE.

Some suggestions from me
1. Don't ever share one towel mostly those living in hostel.
2. Always keep you pubic area clean.
3. If you ever get crab lice just shave off that area and if still the crabs do not come out off your body then pluck one by one with a pair of tweezers.( i know it may take long time but its worth it)
4. Take a hot water bath with added antiseptic liquid (eg. Dettol) in you water.
5. Wash your towels with hot water.
6. Scrub your body with a scrubber.
7. Keep your bed clean and wash the sheets regularly.
Ok that's all.

How can an Indian become an ambassador to the U.S.?	"If you are interested in the diplomatic corps you need to be an excellent communicator, be fluent in multiple languages, acquire a deep understanding of your own culture, country and government. Likewise, develop the same understanding of power, government and culture in the countries where you would like to become an ambassador. Next, you need to network with powerful people in the government and within your area of expertise. A substantial network in the country you are targeting is also essential.
The above implies that you have an area of expertise. It could be trade, agriculture, geopolitical strategies, engineering or many others.
It will take years of preparation to position yourself for an appointment to an ambassadorial post especially if you want a ?õ????plum?õ???ù assignment. Most diplomats work their way up the ladder of the state department of diplomatic corps over a period of years.
The process is that you become an expert, develop a deep network in the Indian power elite and have strong connections in other countries. When you are noticed by the governing party at home, you may be appointed as ambassador. Being noticed depends on the needs of the government falling within your area of expertise. Ambassadors are chosen for their skill, contacts and background. The position can be largely ceremonial or have deeply meaningful responsibilities along with potentially serious consequences.
If your government chooses you as their representative to a particular county, your credentials are forwarded to the host country whose government decides whether to accept you as ambassador.
Although its possible to gain an appointment as political payback, the candidate must also have the right stuff to succeed on the job.
Hope this helps.

What affects the frequency of earthquakes in California?	"The frequency of earthquakes in general follows a simple formula that looks like this:
The bigger the earthquake, the less frequently it occurs. The formula is known as ""1/f noise.""
It is also called ""pink noise."" That's because it involves an element of randomness (""white noise"") combined with a distinct signal (the ""red"" part of ""pink"").
This has applications in many branches of science and technology.
In California, a major driving force is the movement of tectonic plates along the
The effect can be likened to a brick resting on a table, connected with a rubber band to something pulling on it steadily. The pull represents plate -tectonic movement. The friction of the brick resting on a rough surface represents ""stickiness"" or friction. If you do this experiment enough times with a machine steadily pulling, the results plotted on a graph is give you 1/F curve.

How many speakers does a language need in order to develop two dialects? How big of a territory does it need to be spoken in?	"Following on from
Iceland is a geologically complex place where volcanoes have made just about the entire interior of the country uninhabitable. This means more-or-less the entire population lives somewhere along the coast. The majority of those people live in the capital city of Reykjav?ü??k:
(
Reykjav?ü??k is down in the southwest - it is by far and away the most populous city in Iceland. Roughly 336,000 people live in the country; 123,000 of them in the capital. About 99% of Icelanders live in an urban area.
If you look at a map of Iceland you?õ????ll notice that there is one main road that rings the country, and just about everyone lives along it.
Iceland has a highly homogeneous, urbanised population. Its language, likewise, shows little linguistic diversity. The Iceland Government actively enforces this. Among other things, they don?õ????t allow foreign loanwords to infiltrate its vocabulary. Instead, they will invent their own Icelandic-derived words to express new, modern concepts.
The nation?õ????s population is ethnically homogeneous, almost entirely Christian and all share a common cultural heritage. There?õ????s little separating Icelandic people from one another.
Faroese is closely related to Icelandic, and there?õ????s a good chance you?õ????ve never heard of it. The Faroe Islands, where it?õ????s spoken, lie halfway between the UK and Iceland. There are 47,000 speakers of Faroese in the islands (with a few thousand more living in Denmark), yet the language has a large variety of dialects.
The reason is quite simple - the Faroe Islands are islands. Each island?õ????s population gradually evolves its own unique way of speaking. Most people, certainly historically, were unlikely to leave their home island and so certain habits became entrenched within a certain population.
Irish has only about 140,000 speakers, yet its dialects are also extremely distinct. While Ireland does have some mountains, it?õ????s not especially difficult to traverse. There are a variety of reasons why Irish has several separate dialects, and part of that is because Irish is only widely spoken in language ?õ????islands?õ???? within Ireland.
These are called the
As you can see, these
There are few rules dictating whether dialects will form or not. Population sizes don?õ????t matter. Languages don?õ????t tend to diversify unless there?õ????s something isolating separate populations of speakers. Lots of things can cause that, such as:
The geographical size of an area doesn?õ????t necessarily result in lots of dialects (Mongolian, for instance, is a relatively homogeneous language despite the country being massive). Population sizes don?õ????t either. All you need is some kind of force that isolates (or semi-isolates) a group of speakers.

"This bit advice is going to seem counter-intuitive but it?õ????s one of my favorite reminders to mull over in the morning before one goes out to face the day ahead?õ????it?õ????s a way to prepare, philosophically, for what the world has in store us.
The wisdom comes from the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius who writes in his
?õ????When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly.?õ???ù
Now I realize that might sound like a depressing thought, but ask yourself: Would you rather be pleasantly surprised during the course of the day or unexpectedly disappointed? You can be certain as clockwork nearly everyday you?õ????re going to interact with someone who seems like they?õ????re being a jerk (as we all have been ourselves in the past).

It calls to mind a joke from the writer Nicolas Chamfort, who remarked that if you ?õ????swallow a toad every morning?õ???ù you?õ????ll be fortified against anything else disgusting that might happen in the course of the rest of the day. Might it not be better to understand up front that other people often behave in selfish or ignorant ways (the toad) right when you wake up, than it is to dribble it out through the day?

Why is job creation still an economic priority for the Chinese government when its labor force is beginning to shrink?	"Not all the jobs can be done by everyone. If a job anyone can do, it is not a desirable job. Some job categories don't have enough workforce, there are also people don't have enough jobs. For example, new grads from the universities have an employment rate
(Employment rate of new grads in 2009?õ????2011 ) The line on the top is 4-year university graduates. The bottom is junior college graduates. The line in the middle is the average.
The employment rate for fresh grads are uneven across the regions:
This is the employment rate for new grads in 2016. The highest is 88.7% for eastern China (Shanghai, Jiangsu,Zhejiang, Anhui provinces). Notice it is not as good as 2010 and 2011. The lowest is 79.5% for north east provinces. 1 in 5 university graduates were unemployed 6 months after their graduation.
Employment rate across disciplines are also not even.
The chart is the employment rate for universities in Guangxi province in 2016. The red line is the employment rate for fresh grads. The blue bars are the number of new graduates. The highest employment rate is MD, the lowest is the Economics.
The students and their parents invested in higher education, and they are looking for return. The expectation runs high. If their expectation did not meet and the investment did receive any return, they will be really angry. The below chart says more than a quarter of the new university graduates in 2016 think the reason for difficulty to find a job is because the reality doesn't meet their expectations. (The second and the third reasons are: the knowledge learned can?õ????t meet job requirements, and do not have enough information about job and workplaces.). Notice when the available job doesn't meet expectations, they would rather go unemployed than take a labor job.
Low unemployment rate in young and educated workforce is important for the future of the country. That's why job creation is the high priority for Chinese government.

I was telling her that I thought it was a complete waste of time doing a conference on women because conferences gave a brief high for the few days it was held and then things were back to square one for the people attending them. We needed more of a constant support to get women realize their full potential.
She told me why doing conferences were important and quoted her experience in Kerala. It seems in Kerala, the number of women who get into engineering colleges are about 50% and this approximately aligns with the male / female ratio. BTW, in case you are thinking that this happens only in Kerala, this happens in most societies (MP, Haryana, almost all the states in India...)
BUT once they finish engineering, almost ALL (some 95%) drop off, get married, become housewives and throw away everything that they learned. This is a combination of the perspectives the teachers have, the parents have and what the girls themselves are inculcated with. The system was stacked against them. The intention of the #GraceHopperConference was to change some of these.
Think about it. You are already part of that 5%. Today you sit at the desk of an MNC because of various circumstances. You are privileged. And you are asking for more (as you should). Shouldn't you make that more happen for yourself?
I have learned one thing in this life, depression, problems are sent to test us. It is only those who can rise beyond that go out and change this world. Here are some videos and a link that might help:
and the second one is:
Finally, you should read the biography of one of the worlds best known singers - Madonna:

Like Morpheus says to Neo: ""
Edit 21/3/16: I saw this video and I thought this is a must add:
Think of the impact Deepana is having. She comes from a small rural town in Tamil Nadu, didn't make her dream (obviously ISRO rejected her), was essentially told to go, get married and settle down. BUT she persevered. Think of the impact Deepana will have on the subsequent generations of girls and guys (why does it have to be only women?) who hear her story.
Think of the impact that Team Indus will have to the Indian science & technology scene (they are already considered amongst the best-in-class tech startups out of India. A lot of us entrepreneurs are extremely proud about what they are doing), think of the impact on tech startups out of India over the subsequent years. And Deepana is part of that and making it happen.
So, why wouldn't you break out of your self-pity and go make it for yourself.

Are there any books on using debt to invest in stocks?	"I use debt to invest but I would highly recommend you not to do so in the stock market. The reason?
There is something in the financial markets called volatility.
Volatility refers to the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of changes in a security's value. A higher volatility means that a security's value can potentially be spread out over a larger range of values. This means that the price of the security can change dramatically over a short time period in either direction. A lower volatility means that a security's value does not fluctuate dramatically, but changes in value at a steady pace over a period of time.
Problem with stock market, let?õ????s take American stock exchange S&P500, is that it has medium-high volatility meaning there is a medium-high risk that you will lose any/all/part of your investment.
Let?õ????s take 2008 financial crisis, if you had used debt to invest in stock market, you would have lost ~36% of your investment and you would owe the principal to the creditor.
This is a curve that represents risk and return of portfolio with various Bond and Stock splits. This should give you some idea as to what investments are low, medium, and high risk.
As you can see, the higher the risk the higher the return. Since you took a debt to invest, you should be aiming for low risk investments which could be government bonds.
10 year US government bond is currently offering ~2.4% interest with guaranteed principal payment at bond maturity which could potentially make good low risk investment but in your case you have to consider other factors which is:
In an ideal scenario, if you were able to get a loan without any interest and you are only obligated to pay the principal with low costs. This would certainly make a good investment for US government bonds which will provide you with ~2.4% net return.
If you are able to find such scenarios then certainly go ahead and use debt to invest but definitely not in stock market.

Are older people more knowledgeable and conscious of certain situations? Why or why not?	"The more experience you have, the more data you can draw on in identifying and solving current problems. Generally, experience accumulates with age. However, it is also possible to accumulate experience by seeking out lots of different experiences.
Older people will generally have more knowledge and greater consciousness of a wider variety of situations, simply due to experience. However, because other factors are involved, such as willingness to seek out a variety of experience and the ability to make sense out of ones experiences, there is not a direct correlation between age and knowledge. It?õ????s a trend, but there is, as always, variation.

How can I figure out what genre of music I like?	"The artists you mention all play soft, crooning, acoustic guitar-based and melody-driven alternative pop/rock music. The designation of indie would be appropriate to these artists, but is actually wide enough to include independent artists of other genres. But I think you're searching for a more specific term to describe the emotion you have when listening, and the closest thing I can come up with is ?õ????emo,?õ???ù despite that genre being associated with a harder sound. Since I personally have a similar taste in music, I call it the ?õ????sad bastard?õ???ù genre.

When I thought about it a bit, I came to the conclusion that doing things that might hurt others, damage the planet, or hurt myself were just, well, stupid.

It?õ????s set in the future (obviously) and Earth is using the Moon as a prison work force. They send folks to the Moon and they ?õ????harvest?õ???ù minerals from the Moon and send it back to Earth via catapult. They also harvest ice for use on the Moon to keep the habitation areas habitable.
Families have changed significantly. Polygamy is not only accepted, but encouraged. The vast majority of families on the Moon are in some form of polygamy. These can vary wildly, anything from simple 3 adult households to group marriages. And many other variations as well.
At the start of the novel it has been many years since the Moon colony was founded. So it starts out a bit like Australia, in that many of the people currently on the Moon are the descendants of the people originally sent there.
The upcoming movie based on this novel, if it ever happens, is rumored to be named ?õ????Revolution?õ???ù. Which is a major plot point of the novel. Revolution meaning that the Moon wants to be recognized as its own entity instead of being a prison colony. There is a hell of a lot more to the book, but those are the basic settings.

How do inmates seem to stay so jacked up (muscular) on what seems like a limited diet?	"They work out. A lot. Many begin the day they arrive, and never stop. Some prisons offer weights and tracks, basketball courts and the like, others offer farmwork.
Most convicts realize that it?õ????s healthier to be fit. They realize they might defend themselves better if they are fit and strong. They also realize they have just about unlimited time. So the time worn adage of ?õ????I?õ????d work out if I only had the time?õ???ù is one that just won?õ????t fly in prison.
One of the more brilliant books I?õ????ve ever seen on working out is called Convict Conditioning.
What Paul Wade - someone who learned a system from an older con then further refined it while finishing his time in prison - does is to break down the differing kinds of body weight exercises - squats, pullups, pushups, situps and bridges (or backbends) - from their easiest form to their most difficult form. He specifically shows how to start at the easiest, then systematically and slowly work up to the highest form.
The easiest forms of pushups are against the wall pushups. The hardest form are one armed or actually one fingered upright pushups.
The easiest , then a bit harder looks like this:
There are classic pushups off the toes:
Raised pushups:
The hardest looks like this:
Before you can do one handed pushups, you have to master the one handed handstand:
Then you can move to what you see below, someone doing one handed handstand pushups, or harder than hardest.
Even harder than one handed, or insanely hard looks like this:
Needless to say, there is a vast difference between wall pushups and what the guy doing the one handed pushup or what the monk is doing, just as there is a vast difference between playing Chopsticks on the piano and playing Ligeti?õ????s Etudes.
But if you are a convict with a ten (or twenty or thirty, or forty, or life) year sentence ahead of you, and way to much time on your hands, it would behoove you to buy a copy of Coach Wade?õ????s book and begin doing each of the body weight exercises on a daily basis. By the time one finished one?õ????s sentence, one could be in world class shape, with the kind of fitness that only a few persons- most of them dancers, gymnasts, acrobats or martial artists - ever achieve.
Convicts eat a crappy diet. My sister was a prison guard for many years, and one of the things she told me was that prison staff never touch prison food. Ever. You never know what?õ????s in it, or what?õ????s been done to it. But prisoners are faced with eating that same food. They don?õ????t have any choice, unless they happen to be very wealthy and can afford to bring in their own foodstuffs and manage somehow to get the wherewithal to cook on their own. (My sister also worked at the federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, and she said the Mafia guys there did just that. They cooked their own meals, delicious Italian food, and ate their own meals apart from others. They could afford it, and had the pull to manage it.)
Other factors that may affect a convicts decision to work out:
1. Most gangs require that their members work out.
2. Regular meals - meals may be sucky but they are regular and usually contain a fair amount of calories.
3. Lots of sleep. Prisoners go to bed early and get up at the same time, so they get more sleep than most which is conducive to building muscle.
4. Testosterone levels - constant danger jacks up one's hormone levels. If this is overwhelming, what you get is a lot of cortisol. But those who have confidence in this environment - and working out can definitely make you more confident, conversely, release more testosterone.
So, crappy diet or no, lots of things - confidence in danger, time to exercise, steady diet, etc - encourage prisoners to constantly work on their fitness.

"How divided is the GOP, and how will it affect them in 2018 and 2020?"	"I can't see either party being around in 2020. the Country Club GOP guys never liked Trump, the Tea Party clowns or the Xian right, and some of Trump's pro-populist proposals like auditing the fed or defaulting on the federal debt must have them up at night. And I can't see the GOP walking away from impeachment should new evidence point to Trump's collusion with the Russians over oil deals (a shoe that has yet to drop). But the Bernie wing of the Dems is almost as big as the establishment/centrist wing, and the fact that nobody in DNC leadership lost their position after 2016 is not a good sign.
It?õ????s way too early to make predictions about 2020 or even 2018.

What's the strangest thing you ever found in a home you've moved into?	"IN 1987 my husband and I bought a small, extremely rundown, terrace house in the inner city of Sydney. It was all we could afford. In the back yard was a little shed, which had originally been an outhouse (from the days before proper sewerage and plumbing): the toilet had been removed long ago, and replaced by a water heater, around which was dumped an assortment of rubbish. Eventually I got around to cleaning the shed out, and among the litter, I found a battered cardboard box which contained some old plates, part of what looked like a woodwind instrument, and (at the bottom of the box) a stack of photographs. There was nothing identifying on the box, and I threw it away (insects had attacked it, and it was disgusting). The photos were, remarkably, undamaged. I could see that they were mostly from WWI, and mostly from the middle east. Most were stamped with the name Eric Keast Burke, which meant nothing to me, and in 1987 there was no internet to provide instant access to information. I put the photos in a clean file, and set them aside, intending to get back to them. And of course, that didn?õ????t happen. I found them again last year, while looking for something else in my files. The internet immediately told me that Eric Keast Burke was a famous photographer who gave lectures and slide shows about his time in the middle east, and about the history and architecture of the region - and many of the photos have hand written pencil notes on the back: I think they may have been the notes he used when he was giving talks.
I have no idea how the photos got into my shed: Keast Burke?õ????s life is pretty well documented, and he never seems to have lived in the house where the photos were found. All attempts to contact surviving relatives have failed, and the photos are going to be deposited with the Australian War Memorial the next time I get to Canberra. You can see some of the pictures here:

Also, I think you?õ????re misunderstanding the entire colonial thing. It?õ????s not that simple where Europeans came and then left peacefully.

Predictably the second try would look nothing like the first time around, and you would have no idea what the new world would look like.

What is it like to be a fund manager of a top mutual fund?	"It?õ????s a relatively secure and easy job in which the manager has to have a lot of business acumen.
It?õ????s also a position with a lot of perks and a lot f fame. Yet in case of anything going wrong, it is the manager who comes under fire. The position also entails the investment of public money to yield high and steady returns to fulfill shareholder and company expectations.
A fund manager has to regularly keep track of the diverse plethora of investments.

What would happen to modern day Indonesia or the Netherlands if in 1949 the Dutch government never transferred the sovereignty of the Dutch East Indies to the United States of Indonesia?	"If the dutch still control Indonesia and secured her from communism then let her go after 4?õ????5 decades. This may be happen:
1.More liberal Indonesia
Netherlands is the one of the most liberal country in world. If the Dutch still control Indonesia and give her independence we may have a very liberal lifestyle and politics, Non-religion person can be publicly exist, very open minded people especially for the younger generation or millennials. Secularism is one of the religion life principle except for Aceh who use shariah law as their main civil law
2. Asymmetric Federalism
Indonesia is a large archipelago, heterogeneous, and multicultural country. Back then in early 20th Century most of Pro - Independence intellectuals and politicians supported unitary Indonesia. If the dutch still own Indonesia for longer decades, We may become a federal nation like Canada or Russia who use asymmetric federalism because some of the region in Indonesia have their own specialty such as
3. European style government and law
Indonesian will use parliamentary system like Germany or semi-presidential republic government like France, both of them will have Prime Minister. Unlike Netherlans, there will be some more unique ministries such as Ministry of religion, and Ministry of maritime and fisheries. Law still use Dutch law code and there may be no death penalty.
4.Different Political life
There will be multi-party election and have freedom of ideology for every parties. What i think there will be socialist type party, Conservative party, Nationalist Party, Islamic Parties, etc. The election will be more civilized like other European countries.
5. Good education and high HDI
Indonesia will have one of the best education in Asia and then the HDI will be one of the the best in Asia too. This will lead Indonesia to be one of the leader of Technologies in South East Asia.
6. One of the largest economic power in Asia
Although Indonesia in real time is the one of the largest economic power in Asia, but what i mean in this scenario that Indonesia have a power like South Korea or Japan. As like i mentioned before if Indonesia have a high HDI, their citizen will compete more and this may increase the economies, especially in entrepreneurship and large good workforce quality. Indonesia have a rich natural resources, so their industry will be thriving and make a large moneys.
Then what happen to the Netherlands?
Netherlands will be filled by millions of Indonesian. Unlike the post-independence immigration to Holland in Real life, this immigration not only will be filled by the Dutch and Indo People, there will be filled by Native and Foreign Ethnics Indonesian (Especially Chinese-Indonesian) too. because the large number and diverse composition of this immigrants, it may be change the dutch societies (Maybe).

Where should I start my SEO after keyword researching?	"In the world of SEO in 2017, content is one of the most important on-page factors for helping your website rank. Before you start any
Data shows that pages with 2,000+ words of content typically rank higher in Google search than pages with short, light content. Going into detail might take more time, but it has a positive effect on your website?õ????s ability to rank in organic search for its target keywords.
Research also shows that long, detailed pages are more likely to get links than short pages. As time-consuming as it might be to develop long-form content for each of your pages as you build your website, doing so can pay for itself in a greater number of inbound links to each page.
For optimal on-page SEO, include your target keywords in your content occasionally, but don?õ????t overdo it. Google?õ????s algorithm is smart enough to detect
Instead of stuffing keywords into your content, use them strategically. Add your keywords to H1 and H2 tags on your page. Add long tail keywords to H3 and H4 subheadings. Once you finish writing each page, double check it to make sure your keywords fit naturally into the content.
Try to write at least 2,000 words of content for each page, using your keywords when relevant without overusing them or ?õ????stuffing?õ???ù them into the content.
Use the H1, H2, H3 and H4 tags to mention your primary and secondary keywords, as well as long tail keyword variations you?õ????d like to rank for.
Don?õ????t just write for writing?õ????s sake -- try to answer questions your users might have and solve their problems in your on-page content.
Your title tag is the text that Google will display as your page title for every search result, as well as the text that will display in the user?õ????s browser when they visit your page. It?õ????s important that all of your pages have title tags that are
A good title tag should accurately describe the content on your page while mentioning the main keyword you?õ????re targeting for SEO. For example, the ?õ????Men?õ????s Leather Oxfords?õ???ù page on our shoe website above would benefit from a title tag like this:

I would strongly urge you to speak to other first mothers first before you make the final decision.

How many watts are equal to 1 unit in an electricity bill?	"Hello.
The electricity bills are nothing but energy consumption bills and not power consumption bills.
Energy=Power * time
i.e. E=Watt*time
When we say we have consumed 1 unit of electricity, that means we have consumed 1kWhr of electrical energy.
1 Unit=?ˇ?ˇ kilo watt hour.?ˇ?ˇ?ˇ i.e.?ˇ
So, for example if you use 10 watt of lamp for 100 hours, the electricity consumed will be 1000 watt hour. That is 1kWhr, nothing but 1 Unit of Electrical Energy.
Thanks for A2A.
Enjoy!!!

What is 1 kw?	"I would add a different perspective here. To understand anything,its very important to have a ?õ????feel' of that thing. Like, we all know what is 1kg of sugar or anything, because we have its feel,how ?õ????that much?õ???? feels like,thus we understand better. On the same lines, 1 KW of power is 1000Joules/ sec. Fine. But are you getting the feel of 1KW with that statement, ?õ????how much' it is? Well, lets consider an example. Just imagine a closed box (of negligible mass)in which 10 persons each of 100 kg ?õ????weight?õ???? are put together. This box is lying on ground.Now, you have to lift this box upto 1 metre height. Not easy,right? Even the strongest man on earth would sweat lifting it.Work done here would be 1000 Joules. You might be getting the idea of 1000 Joules of energy now. But wait, you have only one second to lift the box upto 1 metre. And by definition, power is amount of work done per second. You can imagine how much 1KW power is. And if you keep repeating this exercise every second for 3600 times, this will sum up to 1KWH energy or 1 unit of energy, for which you generally pay around 4?õ????5 Rs. So our appliances are consuming so much energy on the cost of energy given by 1 banana !!

How can a person maintain a healthy weight if they are a foodie?	"It's all about maintaining balance ,firstly educate yourself when it comes to food ,which food items consist what?
I mean if you are eating mcd burger you should be aware of what's in it ,what each item consist of what kind of macros.
How much protein carbohydrates and fats are there what you eating ,not exactly but yes you can approximate it .
You should learn about your daily calorie intake limit in order to not gain weight .
For example if you weigh 72 kg and eating food compromises of 2500 calories then whatever you eat in whole day should be around 2500 but how?
For example you consumed 2800 calories and normally you take 2500 calories to maintain your 72 kg of weight then you should take out 300 calories either in the form of daily routine or workout .
You don't have to go gym ,just simple workout like this
Can be helpful in burning those calories
So if you maintain your calories intake and balancing your diet you can keep an eye on your weight
Still for healthy tips which you should follow even though you are foody will help you to achieve this goal are as follow:
Make all the below mentioned things as habit as a lifestyle and see wonders,its slow process but permanent and for long term it's best.
Change your lifestyle sir everything will change ,keep your daily routine active ,go out jog walk sprint or run according to your level ,do different ,make a change hope it helped somehow.

How do soldiers deal with really super obviously bad commanders?	"I should start by saying that I did not serve in combat.
If an order is foolish but lawful, military law requires you to obey. You can, respectfully, point out why you think the order is unwise, but you would be pushing your luck to use the word foolish. In the British Army, your attestation oath commits you to obey any lawful order.
I was once advised by a very senior non-con that if given an order you thought was illegal, you had to weigh up the worst possible consequences of obeying and of disobeying. For example, if ordered to load a piece of army property into an officer?õ????s private vehicle, you could defend obeying the order by arguing you did not know the officer was not authorised to take that property home. If your explanation was rejected you would be unlikely to receive a worse penalty than a short spell in the glasshouse.
If ordered to shoot a prisoner of war, you could be convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The defence that ?õ????I was only obeying orders ?õ????, is known as the Nuremberg defence and, at least in the UK and US is specifically denied.
If not in combat or other emergency, I was told to insist on written orders if unsure of the legality of an order; this tends to make even the most arrogant officer think again.
As a matter of interest, one of the reasons for rejecting the Nuremberg defence is the fact that, at the Nuremberg war trials, evidence clearly showed that on a number of occasions German servicemen had refused to obey unlawful orders and had gone unharmed.

How frequently should I get my bike's oil changed? I own an Apache RTR 160.	"Engine oil change interval varies greatly according to the type of engine oil you use (mineral,semi-synthetic or synthetic) and on the type of riding you put on the bike (city or highway). If you have been using mineral oil (including the one from the authorized service station) the oil change interval drops to 2500 km-3000 km for predominantly city riding and around 1500 km if the bike?õ????s been doing mainly high speed highway jaunts (or even if you like to stay in upper third of the tach in the city) because mineral oil degrades rapidly as the engine heats up. If you use semi-synthetic oil like Motul?õ????s 5100 then the oil can do well inside the engine for as long as 3000 km of mainly high revved riding on the highway or the city. The best I find for our mid level Indian bikes is Synthetic oils like Motul?õ????s 7100 which easily lasts 5000 km -6000 km in the city and about the same on the highway. If you do want to go all out then Motul?õ????s 300v lasts almost 10000 km of high stress riding with relative ease but also costs a bomb to replace and needs twice the time to warm up( which still comes to about 5 minutes of idling).
As a rule of thumb, when your gearshifts start feeling notchy and rough its time for a blood transfusion.
Hope this helps.

Can India survive in the 21st Century?	"Oh buddy. You seem to be living under a rock.
21st century is India?õ????s century. Pax Indica.
That is the future.
And let?õ????s come to the present shall we? We have a growing middle class, every day thousands are coming out of poverty.
Now I understand that Western Media may be showing you that this is India
But there is this India. The media doesn?õ????t show you.
Economically, we are going out an great speed. And the numbers, and the growth speak for itself.
The Indian urban middle class, is now providing revenue for giants like Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple, Samsung. We are giving the guys in the West jobs. Not vice-versa anymore.
Our Prime Minister looks weak to you? He fasts, and refrains from eating solid food for weeks during the time of Navrathri in September.
Name one leader in the West, who could do that? Trump nah!
He has successfully toured multiple nations, and the got loads of foreign investment.
He tried peace with our brothers the Paks, and when that didn?õ????t work and the Pakistani government promoted terror in our country. Instead of other weak Prime Ministers. He initiated a surgical strike in their country. And take a look at this.
This is when Modi went to London. British-Indians filled the stadium to listen to his speech in Wembley.
Indians are uncivilised. It seems that a gentleman doesn?õ????t agree with what you?õ????re saying.

India is the nation, where Jews were never killed on the name of religion. India is the only nation where Muslims, have a separate Sharia civil code inspite of the majority being Hindu.
India even welcomed the Parsees from Iran, and they became Indians.
It took India just 20 years, to elect a president from the Muslim minority. It took USA 233 years to elect a president from the Black minority.
India already elected a woman Prime Minister twice. I guess that didn?õ????t happened even once in USA.

Just read these, to see how much work we are doing to make our country the best:
Startup India
Make in India:
Digital India
Clean India
Invest in India
I invite you to India, to come and see the work we are doing to make ourselves and the world better.
This is just a trailer of the work we are doing. There is an entire movie series left.
I as a young Indian, like millions am working harder to get myself and my family rich, pay my taxes. And make my country even richer, cleaner, safer and happier.
Finally buddy. I could say a ton of bad stuff about you. I can ask you, how the US will survive the 21st century, since they elected a orange head racist rapist. Since you?õ????re spelling clearly tells me you?õ????re an American. I?õ????m pretty sure you ain?õ????t a Canadian, because they?õ????re nice people.
But I won?õ????t. We are Indians. Here is a little quote from the Upanishads, the ancient Indian texts:
asato m???Å sad gamaya,
tamaso m???Å jyotir gamaya,
m?≠????tyor m???Å am?≠????ta?≠???ü gamaya
This translates to:
Lead me from falsehood to
Lead me from darkness to light,
Lead me from death to the immortality
I feel the first line applies to you. You are under a pretty bad opinion. I am quite angry on how you said Indians are
Told us about non-violence. He even helped out Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and MLK was inspired from him hugely.
So with his spirit.
I say to you.

How does Steam price their games?	"I have published my own game via Steam, so I know the works.
As a developper you get to decide the price yourself. You can decide on a different price in every currency, but generally you just follow a suggested price scheme. Valve will also try to advise you on the price, if it is unusually high or low.
As for sales, the same rules apply. A developer decides when the game goes on sale and fow how much %. Altough there is a stringent limit on how often you can put your game on sale. Generally, developers give a discount once every 6 weeks or so, starting out at 10% and lowering it by 5 or 10% more every time.
Sales definitely increase profits, lots of people put a game on their wishlist and buy it when it?õ????s cheap enough. Steam also keeps track of how many people have added your game to their wishlist, which helps to decide on the details of a sale.

Which is the better take protein powder before or after the gym?	"STOP!!!
This is utter bro science that there is a window when the protein absorption by your body is maximised.
Do some research and you'll find that research suggests that there is no such thing. The only that really matters is for you to eat the macro nutrients if you are tracking. Otherwise, just eat as protein as is your daily requirement which would be anywhere between 0.8 to 1.2 times your body weight in pounds.
Get smart about nutrition and you'll find it's much more simpler than what people make it out to be.
Hope this helps!

First of all, I am pretty optimistic guy. So, I would mostly have positive point.
If I wasn?õ????t on social media I would have never came to know about people like Jack Ma, Jeff Bezos, Gary Vaynerchuk, Mark Zuckerberg, etc. And FYI social doesn?õ????t only mean Facebook, Instagram, SNapchat and that stuff. Social media contains everything you use on internet like Google or Blogs or e-commerce sites or Quora and many more

Entreprenurship today has a major upside. Befor joining social, I mean at the time when I completed 12th std, I didn?õ????t know anything about entreprenurship or things of that nature. I took IT engineering seeing major upsides and especially for 9?õ????5 happy Job. But social media changed my view on things like Jobs.

I kind of love marketing(though I have never done any marketing and especially by investing money for marketing). I came to know about this guy Gary Vaynerchuk from a facebook video and today he is kind of personal influencer//motivator for me. He always talks about

Which are the best digital marketing companies in India and why?	"I?õ????ll answer this question considering a general approach as it is not clear whether it is from the perspective of job seeker or a customer. but in both the cases, you can safely assume that if the customer base of any company is good, it is largely a good place to work for.. So, it is directly proportional in both cases.
to identify a good digital marketing company, don?õ????t go with the keywords of SEO, SEM, SMM, PPC, content marketing etc.. All of these keywords are basically tools/techniques/technology to do marketing. The best digital marketing company is the place who can talk about running your campaigns to maximise product awareness, to increase customer traffic or traction, to increase conversion rates and to drive revenue growth.
For all of this, it requires to understand the customer profile, their needs and their customers. It requires to build a marketing strategy which does not depend on the tools and techniques but depends on consumer behaviour.
People who understand consumer behaviour will be your best bets if you are looking to either work for a digital marketing company or hire them for your organizational needs.
So, to decide on the best companies, go with the profile of the people who work there and run the show. look at the work they have achieved in their past and whether those people have executed some of the bigger strategies. if you come across people who just talk about SEO, SEM, SMM , content marketing and claim they are digital agencies , stay away from them. With the second kind of people, you are going to lose money if you are a customer, will not grow in career if you are job seeker, will not learn anything new if you are student.

From Online Etymology Dictionary:
Excused is also used in an ordinary way to mean allowed to leave or allowed to be absent from somewhere. A teacher may say that the class is excused from last period due to the predicted thunderstorm. There is no blame or forgiveness involved. It means that the students are not required to fulfill their obligation to attend the last class of the day.

That would depend entirely on a person's ethical outlook.

On the other hand, another person might feel it is ethically correct that a state should cooperate with neighbouring states so that legislation affecting all can be made by a unifying body, as this will promote peaceful and mutually beneficial co-existence.
The main issue is that there are very few universal ethics that everyone can agree on so trying to understand whether or not Brexit is ethically correct is near impossible.

Do you have a personal experience involving adoption?	"Yes, I was adopted.
My birth mother gave me up for adoption while she was still pregnant with me. She chose my adoptive parents beforehand, met with them once, and then when I was born, gave up all of her parental rights.
I spent one week in the hospital with hyperbilirubinemia (my liver wasn?õ????t functioning properly; I do know for a fact that I was not given up for adoption because of this condition, and that my birth mother and all doctors involved didn?õ????t know about it until after I was born) and then three more weeks in the city I was born in as paperwork came through and it became legal for my adoptive parents to take me home. When I was a month old, we got on a plane and came home to Rhode Island, where I spent the rest of my childhood.
My biological mother had a few requests concerning the adoption. She wanted my adoptive parents to send her letters with my progress and pictures of me. She didn?õ????t want a closed adoption, but one of the terms was that she was not to contact my parents; they were to initiate contact with her, and they didn?õ????t have to if they didn?õ????t want to. They obliged with her requests anyway, until they moved to a different town and my biological mother moved to a different town and the adoption agency was absorbed into a larger agency. Paperwork got lost, no one had a cell phone, and with a whole country between us, contact was stopped.
When I turned eighteen, I got my adoption file and a few years later, was able to find them. We now have a proto-relationship. Mostly, I talk to my biological father and sister rather than my biological mother. I think neither of us know what to think of the other. Apparently, despite my never meeting her outside of one visit she made to the NICU while they were treating my hyperbilirubinemia and the fact that she gave birth to me, we are eerily similar. We have very similar personalities, enjoy similar hobbies, have similar handwriting, have similar likes and dislikes, and have similar quirks. Nature versus nurture, anyone?
My adoptive parents had tried for six years to conceive but had no luck. When they decided to adopt, they applied to the adoption agency that handled my adoption, handed in bios and background checks, and settled in for what should have been a multiple-years-long wait. Instead, only a few months later, they were notified that a pregnant woman looking to give her unborn child up for adoption had received their file and chosen them (that was how this agency worked; the mother chose the potential adoptive parents instead of being matched up. I don?õ????t know if other agencies work like this, but I don?õ????t think so). Adoption can also be exorbitantly expensive, but I don?õ????t think my adoptive parents had to pay much beyond whatever fees go with applying to an adoption agency and my biological mother?õ????s hospital bills. My biological parents never tried to change their minds and take me back, and they did keep my biological aunt from trying to petition the courts for custody of me.
All in all, my adoptive parents were very lucky, and in the end, despite identity crises and depression that arose from my adoption, I was also very lucky.

Should I invest in Snapchat when it IPO's?	"This question has probably been running across the minds of thousands of people, as the greatly awaited IPO for Snap, Inc. quickly approaches. Even those not looking to invest are anticipating the IPO.
Well, to answer your question: it depends.
If you?õ????re looking to invest in the short term, it might not be such a great idea. If you?õ????re looking to invest in the long run, it may make more sense compared to the former; but realize that the success of your investment would be reliant on not only the success of the company, but also on how investors feel about the future of the company.
Snap, Inc. (which we?õ????ll refer to as ?õ????SNAP?õ???ù from now on) is responsible for developing the mobile application Snapchat, which has become increasingly popular among young individuals (specifically teenagers, and young adults). However, the financials are not in the clear just yet. A quick look at their S-1 form showed the following:
In 2015, SNAP was able to pull in $58.663 million in revenue, but reported a net loss of $372.893 million.
In 2016, SNAP was able to increase their revenue to $404.482 million. Despite the large increase in revenue, they reported a net loss of $514.643 million.
Their cost of revenue alone was larger than their total revenue. The largest increase in expenses were seen in Sales & Marketing (up over 356%), and Research & Development (up over 147%). While General & Administrative costs were a big chunk, they remained quite steady.
Could SNAP be a successful company? Absolutely. But it doesn?õ????t happen overnight, and takes time. For now, most of SNAP?õ????s valuation seems to be based on optimism and time value (future projections). In regards to the financials, it seems to be overvalued.
The company is being compared to Twitter (TWTR), which is a somewhat accurate comparison. SNAP has the chance to be much greater than TWTR, but it?õ????s got to do better than it?õ????s currently doing.
If you believe in SNAP (the executives running SNAP), and its ability to succeed as a company: go for it, and invest (preferably after the stock calms down from the IPO). Your faith in the executives running SNAP is important because the common stock being issued holds no voting rights.
If you have too many doubts about SNAP, it may be best to sit out and wait before SNAP takes form.

Which is the best time to revise class 11th (science) topics in class 12?	"I assume you are preparing for JEE.
If you have enrolled in a coaching center then they lay out their pattern for exams in such a way that you will cover your syllabus in quite an organic way.
If not then first completely focus on your 12th syllabus till like june and then keep revising your notes. When the school re opens, focus back to 12th again.
Since class 12th comprises about 70% of the paper, it would be better to learn these lesson with full attention.
Post October most of the syllabus would be complete, leaving the small chapters like semi conductor, modern physics, relation functions, lpp etc. (Depends on the school syllabus pattern) Revisit your notes and analyse your strengths and weaknesses now.
When the syllabus is completely over in school and you are preparing for pre boards then completely devote yourself for 11th topics (And study for 12th boards)
After the pre boards you'll have to study everything for jee and boards. Since you'll be scared for boards, you'll study the ncert and small little formulas. Keep away the 11th thing aside now.
So it all zeroes down to-
Best time for full devotion - November to January

These topics are sort of hard but if you keep a touch with them, they'll do wonders. ;)

Why have Bolivia and French Guiana retained high fertility rates when the rest of South America has dropped below 3 children per woman?	"I can?õ????t answer for French Guyana but I live in Bolivia.
The majority of the population of Bolivia live in very very rural areas - Mountains, jungles, plains?õ???? They survive off the land by farming, raising llamas, cows, picking fruit etc. The logic for them is that more children equals more hands to help in the farming.
To a lesser degree, but still equally true, a lot of homeless women who beg on the streets will try to have more children. For the same reason - More children equals more hands extended begging for money.
Most of these people don?õ????t have the foresight to think that more children also equals more mouths to feed. I?õ????m not saying they are stupid and I?õ????m certainly not trying to speak bad of them. But these 2 reasons would justify the rates you ask about. However this cycle is actually not helping their cause and to an extent, it?õ????s increasing the poverty problems in the country. It was in the news recently how a young girl starved to death inside her family home. She was one of a large group of siblings.
In the main cities, where poverty is less and people hold steady, normal jobs, the average number of children per family is two.

How did Bill Gates get people to pay for software rather than accept the free copies openly distributed by the Homebrew Club?	"You seem to be compressing the time scale more than you should. Gates wrote his famous letter to hobbyists in January 1976, when the Altair 8080 PC was one year old and five years before August 1981 when IBM introduced the 5150 personal computer. A lot happened between those two dates.
The Altair was advertised as a ""minicomputer"" on the cover of the January 1975 edition of Popular Electronics - at a price point of $439 for the kit. This created a sensation among the growing stratum of people who wanted their own personal computer - most of whom had experienced computer interaction through timesharing services where the only accessible language was BASIC. Almost none of them had experience using a ""raw iron"" minicomputer where the only available language was machine code.
Thus, when the first wave of purchasers managed to get their Altair assembled they discovered that it was missing a few things, like reliable memory (greater than the 1K static memory which was the limit of the board shipped with the Altair - to get that much the buyer would have to order three more memory chips and solder them in). The 4K dynamic memory available for extra from MITS (the manufacturer of the Altair) was unreliable due to design issues and had availability issues. Third-party suppliers like Processor Technology sprang up quickly to fill the vacuum with 4K static memory plug-in boards.
Also missing was a terminal (the only way to enter and view information on the Altair as shipped was through the front panel switches and lights) and even a serial plug to which a bought-out terminal could be connected. Adding up the list prices (see
Even then you didn't have a BASIC interpreter program. The 4K basic was quoted at $60 for purchasers of MITS systems, but the price was higher if you didn't get all-MITS equipment (at the 1976 World Altair Convention in Albuquerque a look into MITS' demonstrator computer revealed that its memory boards were from Processor Technology). As I recall the price of BASIC for these customers was $150, and $500 if you were not a MITS customer.
At the same time several ""tiny BASIC"" programs cropped up from several authors. Dennis Allison and Bob Albrecht started a publication to support communication among developers and users of Tiny BASIC - Dr. Dobbs' Journal of Tiny BASIC (later the ""Tiny BASIC"" part of the name was removed). There was a growing cohort of Altair users who felt that they were being ""nickled and dimed to death"" and wanted to get an actual computer functioning like those timesharing systems they had used.
Thus, when MITS sent their traveling road show to Silicon Valley late in 1975 to demonstrate their latest and greatest, someone appropriated a paper tape copy of their 4K BASIC, and hobbyists began duplicating it and passing it out. For those who had jumped successfully through the necessary hoops to assemble working hardware, this completed the task. They felt that they had given MITS plenty of money - much more than they thought was the promised price - and invested a great deal of time and effort in learning all the things they needed to learn, and the BASIC was what turned an otherwise useless box into the promised computer.
Of course, Bill Gates noticed the shortfall in income and quickly learned of the copying, which was not kept secret. He righteously wrote to hobbyist publications to demand his due, but he made a tactical mistake in complaining that he and Paul Allen had used ""$40,000 worth of computer time"" in creating their BASIC. This caused the members of the Homebrew Computer Club, at least, to sneer - they all knew that ""computer hours"" were priced for strictly for the benefit of managers and that no one using the systems paid cash for them. The copying went merrily on.
The economic effects of this were significant, though. The market for tiny BASICs collapsed, or at least never developed. Microsoft BASIC became hegemonic as the BASIC used by hobbyists. When a semiconductor company (possibly Fairchild) was about to introduce a new processor chip they inquired as to which was the most popular BASIC and found that it was Microsoft's, so they went to Microsoft to propose licensing it - the copying of Altair BASIC essentially created the market for Microsoft's licensing business.
This all happened well before IBM knocked on Microsoft's door. Gates eventually used the same strategy of flooding the market with free product to wrest hegemony over browsers from Netscape. Such behavior appears contrary to US antitrust law that forbids selling a product at less than its production cost in order to capture a market - but what is the production cost (not price) of software, especially software delivered over the Internet? So you see, two could play that game.

Why do we feel so compelled to search for life's meaning?	"Human beings are inherently optimistic; therefor we believe the answer is out there and we will find it.
We have all evolved as humans with an innate optimism. That optimism exists to a greater or lesser degree in us all.
The human mind has a terrific tendency to forget bad news and remember exactly the specific details of good news. That is so often the case with historical fact.
?õ????While the past few years have seen important advances in the neuroscience of optimism, one enduring puzzle remained. How is it that people maintain this rosy bias even when information challenging our upbeat forecasts is so readily available? Only recently have we been able to decipher this mystery, by scanning the brains of people as they process both positive and negative information about the future. The findings are striking: when people learn, their neurons faithfully encode desirable information that can enhance optimism but fail at incorporating unexpectedly undesirable information. When we hear a success story like Mark Zuckerberg's, our brains take note of the possibility that we too may become immensely rich one day. But hearing that the odds of divorce are almost 1 in 2 tends not to make us think that our own marriages may be destined to fail.
Why would our brains be wired in this way? It is tempting to speculate that optimism was selected by evolution precisely because, on balance, positive expectations enhance the odds of survival. Research findings that optimists live longer and are healthier, plus the fact that most humans display optimistic biases ?õ???? and emerging data that optimism is linked to specific genes ?õ???? all strongly support this hypothesis. Yet optimism is also irrational and can lead to unwanted outcomes. The question then is, How can we remain hopeful ?õ???? benefiting from the fruits of optimism ?õ???? while at the same time guarding ourselves from its pitfalls?
I believe knowledge is key. We are not born with an innate understanding of our biases. The brain's illusions have to be identified by careful scientific observation and controlled experiments and then communicated to the rest of us. Once we are made aware of our optimistic illusions, we can act to protect ourselves. The good news is that awareness rarely shatters the illusion. The glass remains half full. It is possible, then, to strike a balance, to believe we will stay healthy, but get medical insurance anyway; to be certain the sun will shine, but grab an umbrella on our way out ?õ???? just in case.""

Did you ever get fed up of your life?	"Fed up or tired (similar)
I know what it?õ????s like to feel tired ?õ???? and not just in the physical sense.
The world that we live in is an exhausting place to be. It is wearing. It is thankless. It is endlessly trying and scarcely rewarding. You?õ????re tired simply because you live in it. You?õ????re tired of loving too much, caring too much, giving too much to a world that never gives anything back. You are tired of investing in indefinite outcomes. You?õ????re tired of uncertainties. Tired of grey.
I know you haven?õ????t always been this worn out ?õ???? that there was a time when you were hopeful and pure. When your optimism outweighed your cynicism and you had an infinite amount in you to give. I know you have been chipped away and worn down piece by piece ?õ???? a broken heart here and an un-kept promise there. I know the world hasn?õ????t always been kind throughout the games you?õ????ve played and that you?õ????ve lost more times than you have ever won. I know you?õ????re feeling uninspired to try again. I know.
Because the truth is, we?õ????re all tired. Every single one of us. By a certain age, we are all nothing more than an army of broken hearts and aching souls, desperately searching for fulfillment. We want more but we?õ????re too tired to ask for it. We?õ????re sick of where we are but we are too scared to begin again. We need to take risks but we?õ????re afraid to watch it all come crashing down around us. After all, we?õ????re not sure how many times we will be able to start over.
We all think we?õ????re alone in our exhaustion. But the truth is we?õ????re tired of each other ?õ???? tired of the games we play and the lies we tell and the uncertainties we present to each other. We don?õ????t want to play the villain but we don?õ????t want to play the fool either. So our guards go up. Our defences rile. And we take on the role that we loathe to see played because we?õ????re not sure what choice we have left.
I know how impossible it can feel to go on trying and giving and becoming when you are exhausted straight through to the soul. I know that the cheerful ideals you were once promised now seem tired and hopeless. But here?õ????s what I beg if you?õ????re this close to giving up: give it one more try, with feeling. I know you?õ????re tired of your attempts. I know that you?õ????re at your wit?õ????s end. But the truth about that second wind of passion is that you?õ????re never going to realize you have it if you do not keep on running past your first.
We?õ????re all more resilient than we think, and that?õ????s an indisputable truth. There is always more love that we are capable of giving, more hope that we are capable of having, more passion that we?õ????re capable of unleashing and flooding out into the world. We just don?õ????t walk far enough down our own roads to reach the point where we?õ????re seeing those actions pay off. We want immediate results and when we see none, we give up. We let the exhaustion stop us. We grow frustrated with the lack of feedback and we assume that means we have to throw the entire attempt right out the window.
Because here?õ????s something we all loathe to admit ?õ???? none of us are inspired every day. We all get exhausted. We all get discouraged. And we?õ????re allowed to work on through those feelings. Just because you?õ????re beaten down and worn out and sick of the life that you?õ????re living doesn?õ????t mean you?õ????re not making a change. Every person you have ever admired has had times where they felt utterly defeated in the pursuit of their dreams. But that didn?õ????t prevent them from reaching them. You?õ????re allowed to stumble slowly towards your biggest transformations. It doesn?õ????t always have to be a blazing, flagrant affair.
Some parts of life happen quietly. They happen slowly. They happen because of the small, careful choices that we make everyday, that turn us into better versions of ourselves. We have to allow ourselves the time to let those alterations happen. To watch them evolve. To not grow hopelessly frustrated in the in-between.
When you?õ????re tired, go slowly. Go quietly. Go timidly. But do not stop. You are tired for all the right reasons. You are tired because you?õ????re supposed to be. You?õ????re tired because you?õ????re making a change. You are exhausted for all the right reasons and it?õ????s only an indication to go on. You are tired because you?õ????re growing. And someday that growth will give way to the exact rejuvenation that you need.

"Noting that internet moguls control much of the world's wealth, how could digital economics be altered to create a more equitable distribution of wealth?"	"Your false supposition and implied correlations in this question exposes some serious depravity of reason, stemming from a confounding of consequence and cause. Very common in the hallways of populism today, so let me clear the air.
First, the majority of the world?õ????s wealth is not controlled by internet moguls. But indeed, the inflation of their valuations spawned by the public as the innocent greater-fools is giving them a significant presence on the leader-board of the rat-race of wealth.
Second, an equitable distribution of wealth aught to be based on evolutionary merit to all of humanity. Not quite the same as the kind of wealth assigned to those who sell newly minted, yet fabricated monisms of digital economics incompatible with a world in dire need, expecting and deserving of relativity.
Third, we will never know if the world?õ????s resources are deserving of equitable wealth distribution if we do not deploy a relativity of freedom by which a wide and dynamic gamut of evolutionary merit is explored and remunerated. Quite a different exploration than from our stale and inflexible systems of collusion and oligarchy today.
I love the power of technology and worked my whole life in the business of technology innovation, but much of the way technology is deployed now is a complete and utter ruse, an opaque abuse of power causing an enslavement and dumbing-down of humanity. And worse, lulls its innocent participants into a false pretense of freedom:
So, to answer your question and regardless of the role of moguls, digital economics must mimic and subjugate to (our best understanding of) the evolutionary rules of nature.
Rules driven by some very identifiable principles of relativity that already encircle our world. Principles that highlight, emphasize and remunerate the strength of our differences over the stifling curfew of our commonalities. Perpetuated by a dynamic operating-system for humanity designed to consistently explore the very essence and evolutionary merit of why and how we are all so crucially different.

How do I know if I'm a bad programmer?	"No way, you're good for getting started early! Seriously, everyone in software is always learning. If you're not learning... THATS how you know you're bad.
If you want some reassurance, and learn at the same time, have some other developers review your code. You could also try and make a contribution to an open source project, as that will also get peer reviewed. Don't set your bar too high for yourself, you won't be the most incredible developer as soon as you start, just like athletes don't just decide they like a sport and then immediately win gold. But the more you learn, the better you are going to get. You will notice your own progress too, and if you like engineering, that will probably make you want more. Then you can look back at your old work and smile :D
Good luck!

Should I buy SNAP (Snapchat) stocks tomorrow?	"There?õ????s a concept called
Going by old data, you have twice as much chance of getting screwed (as a long) on Day 1, as you have of making every investor?õ????s wet dream: earning a lot of profit in exchange for little effort.
SNAP US is going to go public later today at USD 17.00, beyond the initial price range. So it seems someone really wants to maximize the cash pile! Lord, 60 times revenue? If you have a lean broker like Interactive Brokers or Robinhood, and you?õ????re a disciplined guy who doesn?õ????t mind putting a percentage of his portfolio at great risk, why not? Join the buy-side firms in their party; you might make a little cash.
Going from experience however, tech stocks are far from sure bets. The sector as a whole has a habit of going public at inflated multiples, while having a general aversion to dividends. Since they rule out cash dividends and make PE expansion less likely, that leaves
That?õ????s why any bad news or obfuscation about future earnings can wallop a ?õ????camera company?õ???ù like SNAP US. I mean, at least FB US was smart enough to make high-profile investments in industries not related to online advertising (VR hardware with Oculus Rift, UAVs with Ascenta, etc.). Has Snapchat? Beyond their video goggles? Spectacles is to SNAP US what Whatsapp was to FB US: more a complementary product to enhance their core business/kill competitors, rather than something that will reduce dependence on one product.
Out of 9 acquisitions, only 2 provide pathways to a more sustainable future - Cimagine Media, a company that allows people to make ?õ????virtual showrooms?õ???ù, and Obvious Engineering, an R&D firm that seems to specialize in IoT consumer products.
I think.
Ostensibly, Cimagine Media may allow SNAP US to start making money off B2B deals. Facebook has demonstrated success with the latter, and was priced at 15.8x revenue back in 2015. While SNAP is starting out at 60.0x with nothing but a platform that is competing against both the latter (Instagram Stories) and GOOG US (YouTube is arguably a stronger medium for content creation)?
And in the end, even good tech companies can go through a lot of trouble before emerging to join the likes of BRK US, DIS US and AAPL US. You know, great companies with reliable cash flows and business models.
Facebook was legendary for dropping off the cliff in the year after its IPO. And SNAP US can easily go the way of other unfortunate tech sector peers.
The last tech deal I?õ????ve read of that had revenue multiples of this magnitude was the Tumblr acquisition by YHOO US a few years back.
Look at what happened to them in the end.

I do not represent this as a Buy or Sell rating for SNAP US, but as merely an informational post on IPO arbitrage and valuation methods for tech sector stocks.

My personal advice is not to wear long flowing garments when shooting, as they make for impractical clothes.

In the same spirit of things, tying up your hair can be a good idea as well, and I?õ????d say avoid wearing that long jingly earring that could become tangled and cause you an unwanted visit to the hospital.

How do figure skaters spin on ice?	"You will notice a series of circles left by the skating blades on ice after a figure skater finished a spin. This is because the spin is always achieved on the edge of the blade, not the bottom of the blade. When the skater prepare to spin, they gain speed, twist their body, so the path of their blade is circular instead of straight. When the spin starts, the figure skaters fling their free limbs in the direction of the spin to increase the speed. When skaters change positions, they are supposed to gain spinning speed.
This video explains the physics of figure skating spin much more clearly:

What people lived in the New England Colonies?	"Obviously there were more the Native Americans.?ˇ There were multiple tribes in that area such as the Abenaki, the Penobscot, the Pequot, the Wampanoag, among many others. Archaeological evidence shows that they have been in that area for a long time. They had many conflicts with the European settlers such as the Pequot War and King Philip's War. Many of them died off due to foreign diseases.?ˇ
In 1620 the Pilgrims, religious seperatists, came to Plymouth Rock on the Mayflower, which some of my ancestors came on. The Puritans followed shortly after in 1628, also in Massachusetts. The colonies were disestablished in 1686 and replaced by the Dominion of New England. The Pilgrims and Purtians were against the Anglican Church as they felt the Church was too Catholic. They were influenced by Calvin and other teachers of the Reformed Theology. They left to escape religious persecution. The colony's laws were a fusion of English laws and Biblical laws. Full citizens were called freeman, and many groups were denied full citizenship because of their religion, such as Quakers. Hypocrisy much? Anyway, their laws were infamous for being quite strict, as well as odd for today's standards. It was illegal to play cards, kissing, pulling hair, sleeping during church alongside a bunch of other things. Education was also very important as well. Harvard was opened in 1636 by the Puritans.
The Colony of Rhode Island was another popular and important British colony.?ˇ The founder was an exile from the Puritan colonies. In turn many religious groups settled in the area. Unlike the Massachusetts colonies, the colony allowed religious freedom. It also joined the Dominion of New England
The other colonies were quite similar to the ones I mentioned above.?ˇ?ˇ
Almost all of the one million people in the colonies were descended from the original settlers. By 1723 the Puritan religion had become less popular and was not followed as strictly. During the American Revolution, many important figures came from New England, such as John Adams and his cousin, Samuel Adams, as well as John Hancock. The colonists of New England truly believed in the cause of the American Revoution as the Sons of Liberty was quite popular in that area and the first shot was fired in Concord.
In short, the Native Americans were the first inhabitants of New England during the colonial period. The Puritans and other religious groups came to the colonies, and their descendants became figures in the American Revolution.

How do you audition for the Royal Ballet?	"The two most common ways to gain work with the RB is being recruited through their own school or they will invite you themselves.
Since the RB is the national company and has a renowned school connected to the company they have a constant supply of dancers, educated in their own style. Some people are even accepted into the final year of the school in order to take on a company contract the following season. Accepting dancers with a different stylistic education often proves more trouble than it is worth when dealing with ensemble contracts.
If you are being recruited for something more than a corps de ballet contract then the company contacts you. If you are good enough to be the type of dancer they want in the company (despite your differing stylistic education) you will have been scouted and they will make the offer.
Lacking that, there isnt often the opportunity to show up in Covent Garden with your ballet shoes and ask for a job. There are rarely occasions when the current director wants to know what is outside the RB stable and may call an audition but it will never be an open call (therefore invite through application only) and very few people have ever been taken on by such an opportunity.

What is Na in Chemistry?	"Chemical element, symbol: Na, atomic number: 11 and atomic weight 22,9898. It?õ????s a soft metal, reactive and with a low melting point, with a relative density of 0,97 at 20???ßC (68???ßF). From the commercial point of view, sodium is the most important of all the alkaline metals.
Sodium reacts quickly with water, and also with snow and ice, to produce sodium hydroxide and hydrogen. When it?õ????s exposed to air, metallic sodium recently cut looses its silvery appearance and acquires an opaque grey colour due to the formation of a sodium oxide coating. Sodium doesn?õ????t react with
Sodium in its metallic form is very important in making esters and in the manufacture of organic compounds. Sodium is also a component of sodium chloride (NaCl) a very important compount found everywhere in the living environment. Other uses are: to improve the structure of certain alloys; in soap, in combination with fatty acids, in sodium vapor lamps, to descal metals, to purify molten metals.
Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in The Earth?õ????s crust, which contains 2,83% of sodium in all its forms. Sodium is, after chloride, the second most abundant element dissolved in seawater. The most important sodium salts found in nature are sodium chloride (halite or rock salt), sodium carbonate (trona or soda), sodium borate (borax), sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate. Sodium salts are found in seawater (1.05%), salty lakes, alkaline lakes and
Sodium is a compound of many foodstuffs, for instance of common salt. It is necessary for humans to maintain the balance of the physical fluids system. Sodium is also required for nerve and muscle functioning. Too much sodium can damage our kidneys and increases the chances of high blood pressure.
Contact of sodium with water, including perspiration causes the formation of sodium hydroxide fumes, which are highly irritating to skin, eyes, nose and throat. This may cause sneezing and coughing. Very severe exposures may result in difficult breathing, coughing and chemical bronchitis. Contact to the skin may cause itching, tingling, thermal and caustic burns and permanent damage. Contact with eyes may result in permanent damage and loss of sight.
Sodium's powdered form is highly explosive in water and a poison combined and uncombined with many other elements.
Ecotoxicity: Median tolerance limit (TLM) for the mosquito fish, 125 ppm/96hr (fresh water); Median tolerance limit (TLM) for the bluegill, 88 mg/48hr (tap water).
Environmental fate: this chemical is not mobile in solid form, although it absorbs moisture very easily. Once liquid, sodium hydroxide leaches rapidly into the soil, possibly contaminating water sources.

How do I stop dreading making decisions?	"There are some decisions that everyone dreads. When my first cat got a tumor, I dreaded having to make the decision to put her down if she began to suffer. It never got to that, as she died peacefully in her sleep after only two days.
That kind of dread is normal. Some decisions are hard to make or have very high-stakes and we fear having to make them. Where the fear of decision-making can become debilitating is if it?õ????s irrational. Like dreading having to decide what to eat for dinner, or what shirt to wear.
One way you can overcome an irrational fear of something is to prove to yourself that your fear is irrational and overblown. You do that by applying as much rational thought to your decision-making process as possible. Have a deliberate internal conversation with yourself to alleviate some of your fears, write it down.
You can keep going with this ?õ????if so, then what??õ???ù game for awhile. And if you keep questioning your assumptions using logic, hopefully you will come to a place where you realize that when you actively make decisions, you are taking control over what you can control.
Each time you successfully make a decision or successfully manage the outcome of a decision, you should acknowledge your successes and efforts. It will help you remember that you actually can deal with this the next time the dread creeps up.
Not every decision you make is going to have the outcome that you hoped for, that?õ????s not how life works. Many things are not under our control and even when they are sometimes we make mistakes.

Who are the type of people who are short of admirers?	"Why does it matter? Any person, at any time, may have an admirer; and that may or may not be known to anyone else. Any attempt to quantify the number of someone's admirers seems to me to be a method to value someone else's ( or one's own) attributes.
Admiration transcends the simpleness of quantification.

Are there cheaper and better options than blood tests to diagnose and measure overall health each month to understand your progress?	"Insurance companies would know about it and DEMAND IT. Lab tests are pretty cheap ?õ???? and the blood draws are made with the sharpest needles ever made. The insurance companies need proof that you are being taken care of and you still need monitoring because it is coming out of their pockets.
If you think your doctor is padding the bill with extra tests, then call him on it and make him justify to you why all these tests are necessary. An example would be that you are taking blood thinners so you need a Prothrombin time to monitor that ?õ???? but the doctor is also having a CBC drawn each month along with your prothrombin time test. There may be a reason (anemia) for it ?õ???? but make sure he can explain it to you.

Is it possible for a girl of class 11th to practice cricket along with PCB studies if her parents think that a girl cannot manage these things together?	"Hi There,
I can relate this question to myself as i was also PCM student and that time i used to play cricket as well.
I failed to gain my parents confidence that i can manage both, so i have to chose study option. I didn?õ????t do anything great in that too but my parents thought that if they wont stop my cricket i might?õ????ve got failed in class 11.
But if you are serious about it, then
My advice here is, maintain a proper time table as PCB needs much more attention. Adjust your study/coaching/school timings accordingly. I know a person who did both and is really a good player in his whole university, but maintained cricket as a hobby only, not profession.
Also get some time for yoga/meditation as it?õ????ll help in keeping your concentration and calm. And in the end just listen to your heart, what you are and what you really want to be? Where you want to see yourself in next few years, as A Doctor or A Cricketer?
Please let me know what you?õ????ve chosen. All the best for your future.
Cheers,

What made you sad today?	"Remembering the day my dad lost his job. It was so long ago, and yet I remember it vividly. And it makes me sad to remember it.
I don't know how old he was. Late 30s, early 40s I reckon.
But I remember that he'd been doing well. He'd been traveling to Norway a lot. He?õ????d become a manager. He'd got a cellphone, back when cellphones weren't as common.
He'd worked at the company for around 15 years. I'd been there many times. We knew the people there. That company felt like family.
And he looked really good. I remember that. He'd bought a new overcoat and scarf and gloves or something like that, but I remember he looked sharper than he ever had before.
One winter day my mom called us out into the driveway. There he was, in his coat and his gloves, but something was wrong.
I couldn't remember the last time I'd seen him cry. It must have been years. He really isn?õ????t the crying type. Yet here he stood, with tears in his eyes.
He'd been fired, he told us. I remember asking if he could reapply or ask them to rehire him. He said he had.
It was scary. He said it would be OK. He said he'd find another job. But I could tell he was scared too. He hadn't been on the job market in ages.
He received about nine months severance. Turns out he'd been fired over office politics, and they tried to rehire him a few months later. But he turned them down.
After the better part of a year, he got a new job. It paid a lot more. He had to drive farther, though.
Over the next decade, he's worked at a handful of companies, never staying anywhere for more than 4 years. That's just how it is beyond a certain level; if you want to keep advancing, and if you can see if the company?õ????s headed in a wrong direction or under new leadership, etc. you move on, and you move up.
After about 8 years he was making double what he'd made at that old job. He's happy. He's successful. I'm proud of him.
But I can still remember that day when he came home and stood there in the driveway in his black overcoat and his grey scarf with tears in his eyes. And it still makes me sad.

Which football player would you most like to sit down with and have a quiet word about their career with and why?	"I think an obvious candidate would be the Brazilian striker Adriano. But where would you start?
Jack Kenmare in
Forever remembered as a absolute fire cracker on Pro Evolution Soccer, Adriano was once regarded as one of the top strikers in world football but six years after his last appearance for Brazil against Ukraine in 2010, things are very, very different.
Adriano reportedly depends on a deadly gang known as the Red Command, who have been part of Rio's long-running gang war, for protection in order to live in the slum, according to Brazilian lawyers.
The former Brazil forward was also recently spotted holding rifles with gang members, while posing using the Red Command's hand signals.
It's not the only incident that has sparked controversy in Adriano's life. He was arrested on charges relating to drug trafficking. After a night out clubbing with friends, a woman was shot in his car.
Adriano is always in Brazilian newspapers and after his last contract with fourth tier side Miami United was cancelled in May, nobody actually knows if the once prolific forward is still looking for a club.

Why can't they see they're wrong about people with different beliefs marrying?	"We were humans first, long before even the Institution of marriage came into existence. Religions came in after marriages, families, clans etc emerged. Earlier rules of marriage were not there. Every female in the clan/herd belonged to every male in the herd. (look around the animal world even now. Later the human herd broke up into clans and the Patrirarch became the sole proprietor of al females in the clan. Children moved out as they became adults.They set up their own clans and continued as such, until girls joined other clans as brides, and boys brought in girls from from other clans. Much later the professional alliances brought selective acquisition of brides, depending on the occupations their parents followed. What later became Caste system in India, was such a professional alliance of people with similar expertise: eg: Carpenters, Gold Smiths, Weavers etc.

Are freshly sliced tomatoes better salted or unsalted? Which is preferred by the majority?	"Depends upon the tomato variety, how it was grown, the growing conditions. Some varieties, such as the Jelly Bean ""grape"" tomato, have a slightly salty taste right off the vine. Others, such as the Oxheart and bicolor types, are so sweet and flavorful that salt, in my opinion, is a distraction. A regular red beefsteak, such as Big Boy, which has a balanced flavor between tart and sweet, and with a firm flesh, can sometimes benefit from a little salt.

Where do we get best cakes in Vadodara?	"So you can get good cakes all over the city. If you want customized cakes, the list narrows down a bit. I'm not going to say that the names I'm about to suggest are the best or there's no one like them, because everyday levels change and everyone produces everything almost similar to each other.
So two of my personal friends bake in Vadodara and have achieved distinguishable success. Baker?õ????s Bar by Vishakh Ahuja is a great one because he belongs in the business. His family already worked in this and he started his own venture. He can suggest all the possible as well as impossible customization you can do on your cake. I've never had any complaints regarding his cakes (I've bought at least ten times from him). Another is Cake Alchemy by Disha Naik. She bakes everything at home and with a lot of passion. Though, because she does it all by herself, I'd suggest you place an order in advance. She has been trending recently amongst the youngsters because of the unique looks that she gives to her cakes.
Gandhi and Kabhi B and all others are as good. But if you want personal attention and detailed customization and precise one, too then I'd suggest you hit one of the above. You can find both of them on Facebook and if you want personal contacts, feel free to message me.
I hope this helped you. Cheers!

How would police officers feel about a requirement to load rubber bullets as the first four rounds in their sidearms?	"When a person, police officer or otherwise, gets into a real-life shooting confrontation, that person, in the majority of cases, won't be able to tell you how many shots were fired. Even if it?õ????s just two or three shots, the person will say the wrong number most of the time.
This is an inescapable fact of human psychology and physiology. It?õ????s not based on panic or irrational fear. When our brains decide that we?õ????re in a life-threatening situation, such as one where a gun may be required, they turn off or suppress certain functions and divert all resources to what evolution has determined are more critical functions. Complex physical processes, like drawing and firing a gun, are only possible if those movements are so practiced that they can happen almost subconsciously, using what us laymen call ?õ????muscle memory.?õ???ù
A person who was just in a shootout won't even know how many shots he fired most of the time. He might, honestly,
This is why cops who remember their training will never say how many shots they fired. ?õ????I fired until the threat was over?õ???ù is the most you will get, because their trainers have pounded it into their heads that even if they
How I ?õ????feel?õ???ù about the hypothetical prospect of loading some number of less-than-lethal rounds into a handgun as a matter of policy really doesn?õ????t matter. What I
Back when we carried shotguns, we had access to bean bag rounds which were capable of being fired from any of our guns. However, policy forbade us from loading bean bag rounds into our normal shotguns. We were only allowed to load them into shotguns with special, bright orange stocks and forearms (the parts which would normally be wooden or black synthetic). The ?õ????orange guns?õ???ù were perfectly capable of firing lethal ammo as well, but this too was forbidden. You don?õ????t mix lethal weapons with non-lethal. Allowing this to happen would
Lethal weapons have to be lethal all the time, and less-than-lethal weapons have to be consistent as well. Trying to mix the two into the same platform is a recipe for disaster.
We carry our Tasers on the opposite side of our belts from our guns. Know why? It?õ????s because some officer who was wearing them both on the same side consciously decided to reach for his brand new Taser one day, but due to long habit and muscle memory in the heat of the moment, he grabbed his gun and killed a man who he wasn't justified in killing. In his rational mind, he decided to draw and fire his Taser, but his subconscious mind executed the long-practiced motion of drawing and firing his gun. He didn't go to work intending to become a murderer that day. So, we keep our gun-shaped Tasers on the opposite sides of our bodies from our actual guns to avoid such mistakes which are a built-in part of human nature.
We humans can't trust ourselves to consistently grab the correct weapon when lethal and less-than-lethal are somewhat similar and carried on the same hip. There's no way it?õ????s a good idea to combine them into the same weapon by front-loading a few rounds of rubber bullets into our pistol magazines.
Besides, even though you said to ignore it, this really would never work from a physics and mechanical perspective. A gun is designed to throw projectiles within a certain range of velocity and mass. To switch from lead bullets at lethal velocities to rubber bullets at less-than-lethal velocities would require, at a minimum, swapping out the main springs in the guns. Slide weight would probably need to be changed too, and at that point we?õ????re talking about swapping out half the gun.

Who should Manchester United sign this summer?	"Before this question can be answered, a few questions need to be asked.
First, does Jos?ü?? plan on sticking with our CBs? Because I feel that Smalling, Jones and Rojo are midtable defenders at best. However, they have been playing well and if he trusts them, we can forget about Giminez.
Second, is Luke Shaw going to play for United again? Seriously, where the hell is that guy? If we need to keep playing Darmian or Young at LB for desperate measures, we might as well sign a decent LB. Lucas Digne or Layvin Kurzawa are a couple of LBs I like. But if we're going to be spending big,you can expect someone like Ricardo Rodriguez soon.
Third, what're we doing about Michael Carrick? I feel this is going to be the most important signing of the summer. Carrick has never been on the losing side this season. That, I feel speaks a lot about how important his role is. Casemiro or Veratti would be ideal replacements but again that's a bit unrealistic. I'd love to see Bakayoko or Ruben Neves in that position. But hey! Look at your own academy! There's Fosu-Mensah!
Third, will Zlatan be the same next season? Maybe he will. Maybe he won't. He keeps silencing his critics but I seriously doubt if he'll be able to live up to the title of, well, ?õ????Zlatan?õ???ù. So here comes one of my favourite players, Antoine Griezmann! I'm dying to see the Frenchman in a United shirt and hopefully he'll make the desirable impact!
So yeah, these are the players I think we should sign this summer.

Can gas give you chest pain?	"Some times indigestion can cause pain in the abdomen and chest area. But more commonly chest pain can be caused by acid reflux from your stomach into your oesophagus that results in chest pain. To ease this you should take some antacid.

If your chest pain is a common symptom after eating, you can try a few lifestyle changes like not eating spicy or oily food, not lying down after eating and taking a walk after you to eat to ease digestion

Why are Europeans thinner than Americans?	"I?õ????m an Italian who has now lived in the US for about 12 years and spent quite a bit of time thinking about and rationalizing this question, especially now that I have kids whom I want to raise with a strong understanding of nutrition and well being.
Before I start, please
As an immigrant from Europe one of the first thing you notice in the US is a nationwide problem with overweight issue and obesity, which is particularly striking for youth. Obviously there are socio-economic aspects to it, but socio-economics comes into play anywhere in the world, yet poorer Europeans do not have a particularly higher propensity to weight issues.
I think one of the foundational problems in the US and differentiatior with Europe is the absence of a ?õ????DNA of healthy eating habits?õ???ù. I?õ????m not talking about a mom explaining to her kids that fried food is worse for you than fruit. I?õ????m talking about generations and generations of families cooking and shopping for food in a certain way. For so long that it almost becomes part of your DNA. An Italian doesn't know any better than an American how much sodium is in bag of chips, or how much cholesterol is in a slice of cheese, or how much sugar is in a donut. But an Italian intuitively knows what a healthy portion of cheese is, or how often you should be eating red meat. We do not think hard about it, yet we find very natural balances (except for pasta, but that?õ????s another story). Long term this makes all the difference in the world because the moment an American stops forcing him/herself reading labels or following diets, there is a high likelihood to revert to sub optimal and unhealthy habits.
So, that?õ????s a big factor, and strongly correlated with a chicken and egg situation where certain aspects of american life make it difficult to start building that DNA I was talking about.
For example, Americans work really hard. REALLY hard. Hard work is a staple of american culture and a pride for many. When you work hard, work becomes an increasingly large portion of your day, which means that many times people find it hard to come back home and cook something from scratch. Many European cultures favor slower paces, and being successful through work is far less praised than, for example, enjoying life, having fun, taking it easy. I have rarely seen anyone in Italy reach the stress levels at work that I have observed in the US. And I have almost never seen people working long hours as often as I observed here in the US. When you leave work with plenty time of your day still available to you and a relaxed happy mood, it is far easier to come back home and be willing to put in an hour to cook something healthy and delicious instead of just reaching for some frozen burgers or stopping by a fast food to grab a bite. BTW- ?õ????grab a bite?õ???ù is one of those american saying that speaks loudly about the rush rush rush american culture.
And when you rush all the time you end up eating out more often. And when you eat out you get larger portions than you would cook, you have zero control over ingredients, and kid yourself into thinking that you?õ????re eating healthy because you did not get the fried chicken on the menu.
Talking about fast foods, I can share that I have to drive past a Taco Bell, a McDonald, an Arby?õ????s, a Wendy?õ????s, a Chipotle before I can get to a grocery, and a few more fast foods if I want to get to a farmer?õ????s market. In Europe you?õ????d have to pass through four or five markets before you can find a fast food joint.
Having kids I noticed how hard it is to fight the well being war in the US, even with what I believe is a head start for my kids given their family?õ????s background. Believe me, I understand how hard it is. I go pick them up in school and they are being given muffins, we go to a party and they get low quality pizza and a cake with an amount of frosting that would make me puke, plus sodas and, let?õ????s not forget, a ?õ????thank you?õ???ù bag of goodies with candies and lollipops. Then I need to spend time at the kitchen table explaining why veggies are good for you and portions are far smaller than what they get in school. And then they want dessert because food if being treated as a reward in school.
It?õ????s an uphill battle, but it can be done and must be done.

Are guys intimidated by confident girls?	"Here is Jessica Pointing.
She is from Copenhagen, attended MIT for two years, and is currently enrolled at Harvard University as a Physics and Computing major.
During her undergraduate career, she has interned/work experience with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and with MIT as a computing consultant and a teaching assistant.
Right now, according to her LinkedIn profile, she is a Quantum Computing Researcher at MIT.
With that said, do I believe she is a confident woman?
Absolutely.
And I believe Jessica, solely based on her education and her various areas of work experience, she is a confident woman.
I would be intimidated of her.
Not only because of her impressive resume, but combined with her good looks, I think I am out of her league.
She deserves someone who has similar ambitions, strives towards greatness, and waste no time when it comes to education.
All of what she has done within a mere 4 years proves she has high standards, and expects nothing but the best when it comes to dating.
She has her own friggin website!
Would she go for someone like me?
I would never say never, but in this case, she did give me an opportunity and she is now my girlfriend.

Hw do I deal with lonliness and what people think about me?	"A good rule of thumb is that what everyone thinks about you is their problem and nit your concern. Often we think people are watching or judging us and they really aren't watching or caring what we do. As long as you are not hurting anyone or destroying anything thete will not be a problem.
As for being lonely, there seems to be a little anxiety there. Is loneliness a choice or you feel isolated?
Best advice. Be yourself, stand up and do what you do best. Smile and greet people,be polite to others and you may be surprised where that leads.

How did you feel when you went to a gay club for the first time?	"One day, a few years back, I was visiting central Buenos Aires with my family. It had been a delightful summer day. We had spent the morning and much of the afternoon visiting various places in the city, and we decided to have a good coffee before we hopped on the subway back to the hotel (
Well, so naturally we walk into the first
After a few minutes, we noticed the two ladies clad in black who were behind us were looking at us and grinning, and I vividly remember the employee smirking as well.
And then we looked around, we all went ?õ????oooh?õ???ù, and realized exactly where we were.
We had walked into a gay club.
When the employee, so to speak, realized our realization, he laughed - and so did we, though nervously so. And so did the ladies behind us.
We joked with him about our mistake for a while, he said it was OK, we paid him, and left.
It was awkward, funny, but not much of a big deal.

Can anyone help me find a song?	"how about this:
Deeper and Deeper
Madonna
Lyrics
Deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter, and sweeter, and sweeter
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
Round and round and round you go
When you find love you'll always know
I let my father mold me
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
The deeper I go

Would evolutionary science have advanced more quickly if Charles Darwin had access to Gregor Mendel's findings on heredity in the late 1860's?	"Absolutely. Mendel knew this, and sent Darwin a copy of his 1866 paper, which Darwin never read. It lay, the pages uncut (you used to have to cut the folded sheets of paper to read books and journals), among his inventoried belongings at Darwin?õ????s death.
Mendel?õ????s work showed that blending inheritance was a phenotypic, not a genetic phenomenon. Thus genetic variability is relatively constant from one generation to the next, and natural selection has plenty of raw material to work with in most cases.
Without Mendel, Darwin himself began to worry about the erosion of genetic variability, and he made a few awkward gestures towards Lamarckism. Other researchers began to see evolutionary ideas as more natural history than modern experimental science. When Mendel was discovered in 1900, the study of inheritance suddenly became modern, and mutation became the focus of evolutionary thought. Within about 20?õ????30 years Darwinism and Mendelism were seen to be entirely compatible, producing what became known as the Modern Synthesis. Look at the work of Ronald Fisher, JBS Haldane, Sewall Wright, Julian Huxley and Theodosius Dobzhansky.
Darwin was a clear thinker, but he did not have Mendel?õ????s feeling for the quantitative and the abstract. If Mendel had done a post doc with Darwin (to put it in modern terms), the ?õ????Modern Synthesis would have been accomplished 50?õ????60 years earlier.
Would this have helped inspire an earlier discovery of the role of chromosomes and DNA? Probably so, but there is only so far we can go in reconstructing alternative timeline history.

Is dictatorship better than democracy?	"Dictatorships are often (but not on all occasions) very brutal and often times deny basic human rights. They abuse their own citizens, starve them and do not allow them to travel. Dictators constantly fear being overthrown by their citizens, and that is why they feel if they ?õ????beat?õ???ù them into submission then they will remain in power although they often make many enemies (as in countries) in the process. Citizens living in a dictatorship have no say in who their leader is. They often convince their citizens (especially the ones born into the country) that there is no better life outside their country. This leads them to not even try for a better life since they have been raised to believe a better life doesn't exist.
Democracies can sometimes turn tyrannical but this is much rarer then you might expect as they leave the power up to the people. In democracies, choosing your representatives is a powerful, powerful thing. You choose the people and that means they advocate for you, it?õ????s a system unrivaled be a dictatorship. People are (for the most part) treated fairly. They face fair trial, and no one is above the law which means even the President of the United States can be arrested if he breaks a law (although sometimes situations such as these aren?õ????t enforced the right way but no system is perfect).
This is an opinion question so there isn?õ????t really a ?õ????right?õ???? answer, but for most people, this is a no brainer. Democracy is by far the more fair system although by no means perfect.
I?õ????ll leave this up to you to decide, let me know what you think.

Can you have space without time?	"This is a great question, one of metaphysical contrast.
Firstly, at a glance I would argue that it might be possible to have space without time.
Then I realized that Space is a property of time by arguemntitive standards and thus could not self exist. What I mean by this is simply (or not so simply) that Space is a function of time, both in relativistic and real life definition. Space is a created fabric due to the expansion of our universe and can not selflessly exist without time.

Why do we need to use a DC equivalent or RMS value in AC calculations?	"Because the voltage and current are fluctuating constantly, the power is not constant over one cycle of the AC like it is with DC. There are times when the instantaneous power is higher, and times when the instantaneous power is lower. To get the power that's coming out the other end we have to do something special.
If we use the average voltage over a half cycle, and the average current over a half cycle, we don't get the true power. Basically, a long time ago somebody figured out you have to do this root mean Square thing of the voltage and current to get the true power. RMS is like a geometric mean.
Power is a little bit of a strange concept because it is a second-order function. This means it is a product of a voltage times a current. It takes the product of both voltage and current in order to get the power. The fact that it is the product of two quantities makes power a little difficult to understand intuitively.
Please remember, you can have an RMS voltage and you can have in RMS current, but you never have what is called RMS power.
When we talk about power we are talking about the average power. We say average because we have to average it over 1/2 cycle, or multiple half Cycles, in order to get the true power similar to a DC circuit.

Great question. One that public speakers throughout the ages have asked. And come up with some proven formulas.

These introductions are tried and tested. They work. They get your audience?õ????s attention. When you use one of them, you?õ????ll be on a role. That?õ????s the most difficult bit over with. You have registered with your audience. They are with you.
So what do we mean by . . .
These are short sayings from people that the audience knows or has heard. Sources of quotes can be found at your local library for free or bought from Amazon.
These include the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, The Ultimate Book of Quotations and the Forbes Book of Quotations.
This is a dramatic fact that illustrates your topic (such as: ?õ????We could walk to the moon . . . if we did 5 minutes exercise a day?õ????).
Sources of Startling Facts include the Guinness Book of World Records, Who wrote What When?, and Chambers World Fact Finder.
Audiences love a question. It puts them in control. They are confronted with a situation that only they can solve. Plus, they are ready to listen to different views to help them resolve an issue. This is a great way to engage with your audience. Make sure your question needs thought (who, what, why, when, where, how).
A great way to create an interesting question is to take an article headline that is a statement and turn it into a question. For example: The headline might be a statement: ?õ????Yogurt is good for dementia?õ????. You would turn this into a question: ?õ????Is yogurt good for dementia??õ???? The beauty of this method is that the article will contain enough information for you to create the body of your speech.
Other sources of material for questions are quiz books and BBC fact books.

Is there any other anime that has a similar rival/best friend chemistry such as the one between Guts & Griffith from Berserk?	"It isn?õ????t exactly like Guts and Griffith's relationship but Afro Samurai and 91 Days would be two solid anime that deal with this kind of dynamic.
Afro Samurai is about a black Afro haired Samurai looking to avenge his father?õ????s death from the Strongest man in the world. There?õ????s is a friend from his past that wants to kill him but its not the entire focus of the story. A Senien anime with your typical violence, and dark setting. Fight scenes are damn good.
91 Days deals with the mafia and a boy avenging his family?õ????s death from the mafia crime families. He develops a friendship with one of the top brasses of the crime family which creates a huge dynamic of the boy trying to earn his friendship and the reveal that eventually happens in the anime.
Personally, Berserk is best dealt with as the manga, which the art, the story, and the lore will captivate you much more than the anime can 10x times brutal and tragic than the anime. The later arcs after the Golden Age arc are brutal and beautiful to behold.
Thanks for the question.

What would you say to someone holding a gun to your head to get them to spare you?	"One foggy morning in
Just beyond Prudential Center, home of the Jersey Devils, a distant voice begged the time. Without so much as a passing glance, I squared my shoulders against the jagged rain and quickened my eastward pace. Only the sound of sodden bootsteps and the faint screech of a distant train dared echo across the often-crowded avenue - abandoned by desperate cut-rate cab drivers in such dreary twilight hours.
The words boomed baritone, far closer than before, betraying a slight southeastern drawl and deliberate attempt to maintain stride.
A cautious over-the-shoulder glance caught the hooded stranger in half-sprint, slowing as he noted the pivot of my head.
Licking my lips, I smiled to nothing and no one; exhaling a sharp scoff as I calculated the outcome of countless desperate scenarios soon to manifest.
I had to buy time. Newark Penn Station towered a mere two blocks away, with its K-9 patrols and CCTV surveillance network. Too far.
Its now or never.
My right hand plucked out a refurbished iPhone 3G as I half-glanced at its dim screen, knowing full-well what time it was.
Seconds later I stood with my back near Gateway Center Two?õ????s locked doorway, faced across the Edison ParkFast lot, hoping the lens of a local security feed would record our clash for posterity.
A matte black .44 magnum Smith & Wesson long-barrel revolver materialized in his right hand, rising to my forehead with agile precision. Despite an oppressively humid 75 degrees, I shivered as its cool barrel prodded damp flesh.
My right hand twitched slightly, purposely clutching my outdated smartphone, drawing his attention.
I can?õ????t claim to understand why I reacted as I did: but the recent, agonizingly slow Leukemia-born death and decay of my best friend J played its fated part.
With a voice deeper than I have known before or since, I calmly spoke the four words I would come to repeat countless times thereafter.
I gazed deep into his dark brown eyes and felt no loathing nor fear - only pity and understanding as he tilted his head in confusion.
We stood there for what seemed an eternity, the maelstrom rain pounding its phantom swirl as he struggled to process my words.
I spoke those four words louder now, a stoic timbre of inhuman depth born from the hollow chamber where once stood the pride and dignity of an idealist.
Knuckles turned pale as the grip on my phone tightened; words echoing slowly, effortlessly - paradoxically apathetic yet born of profound emotion.
I saw no rage nor resentment in his eyes. No thirst for violence, nor anger at my reaction. They bespoke intelligence and a life of born of tragic circumstance. In another world, this man would have become a doctor, a soldier, an engineer.
For a moment I felt sorrow for the thankless life into which he was born.
In another world, that would have been me.
Our eyes remained locked beyond the barrel of a gun, drawn by the gravitational pull of that moment.
I contemplated what might transpire next as my left hand slid a concealed blade from its sheath, hidden beside a set of throwing knives in my pocket.
It must have seemed a hell of a show: a leather-clad, long-haired metalhead and a dreadlocked mugger standing wordlessly, face against face, exchanging a profound depth of expression by the wellspring of suffered gazes beyond the edge of a blade and the glimmer of a loaded hand-cannon.
?õ????Until I noted his relaxed body tense anew, gaze averting behind me just before another man grabbed at my phone from behind. In retrospect, his accomplice was likely standing nearby, watching for a cue to intercede or walk away. Seeing the knife in my hand, he figured he?õ????d end the showdown safely by snatch the phone and escaping.
Unfortunately, you don?õ????t touch someone with PTSD from behind - earning a reactionary elbow to the face as I growled and backstep-swiveled angrily, unconsciously raising my knife to a reverse-grip down-strike position.
?õ????Oops.
The gunman?õ????s eyes widened and down went the barrel, straight over my heart. At this moment, the game was over.
Its risky enough to offer your phone with your right hand to distract the gunman and chance him reaching for it with his left hand, possibly using your phone as a bludgeon to skew the gunman?õ????s grip while hes distracted, parrying or latching onto a bulky firearm to one?õ????s head while slashing at the exposed throat with an unorthodox left-handed reverse-grip. All the while back-pedal side-stepping out of the immediate fire path. Preferably ending with a secondary series of stabs to induce shock and rapid blood loss, taking care to manage an opponent?õ????s non-dominant guarding hand and, depending on the confusing tangle of limbs, close the distance to avoid that guard-hand blocking your strikes or securing the firearm with a two-handed grip resulting in a lethal .44 caliber body-shot.
Fighting off opponents on two fronts, one of which you can?õ????t even see, after losing the element of surprise with a point-blank gun held center-mass?õ???? That?õ????s suicidal.
I immediately released the iron-fisted grip on my phone, to the accomplice?õ????s confused chagrin as it clattered to the damp ground. I held firm the grip on my knife but passively brought it toward my chest and back down to my left side, shaking my head with a frown.
The accomplice bent down and grabbed the phone then half-circled behind me to disarm my knife-hand. After a solid 15 seconds of ineffectually struggling to release my one-handed death-grip with his left hand and fish through my back pockets with his right, I pulled a wad of bills from my right pocket and dropped it.
Turning my blade sideways and holding it out palm-up, I ended my own threat and displayed submission to avoid getting shot or stabbed from either of the two.
While the accomplice fumbled to grab the money, the gunman reached out with his left hand and grabbed the knife.
I nodded and offered tribute to ease the tension. A simple, effective tactic of submission that helps to lessen potential aggression from pissing off your armed mugger who just wants to score and bail.
I carefully pinched the tip of the sheath holding the throwing knives and lifted it into his reach, never touching the blades themselves. I expected the accomplice to grab them, but the gunman put the original blade in his jacket then grabbed the throwing knives as well. I guess he really liked them and didn?õ????t want to share.
Satisfied, he looked me in the eyes one last time then backed away, turned toward the street and crossing it. As his accomplice passed me, I noted he was a stocky if not chubby light-skinned White or Latino male in his mid 20?õ????s to early 30?õ????s, likely Puerto Rican or Columbian based on facial structure; while the gunman was a Black male in his early to late 30?õ????s, possibly late 20?õ????s in bad health - which didn?õ????t seem the case.
The moment the accomplice passed me, I immediately began taking wide-stepping backwards as fast as possible. Learning to speed-walking backwards was useful after all. When the gunman reached the other curb, the accomplish said something I didn?õ????t hear: at that moment the gunman paused, turned around, and began walking back toward me. Likely, the accomplice made a case for killing the crazy heavily-armed metalhead who stared at his face for a good 5 minutes straight.
The moment he paused, I knew what was coming - so I spun on my heels and sprinted as fast as my legs could carry me, steel-toed combat boots be damned. Taking care to zig-zag between the planters, decorative mini-trees, and obstructions conveniently placed every few feet along the curb, I made it up a block and a half and ran into the middle of the street waving my arms at a passing taxi. The Latino driver was obviously confused and afraid, but he had to stop or risk running over the guy with his hands in the air.
I explained in Spanish that I just got robbed, they have guns and are down the block, and to avoid driving that way at all costs. After the obligatory ?õ????call 911?õ???ù, I asked for a ride and was promptly dropped off at home.
I still don?õ????t entirely understand why I said what I did. Nor, for that matter, why he didn?õ????t just shoot me and shut me up. Or pistol whip me a dozen times like they did to a friend in a separate incident.
This event, though not the first time I?õ????ve been robbed, stabbed, or shot at, changed my life. I left the insurance industry and became a security officer as a direct result, just I like to argue that getting her skull fractured via pistol-whipping prompted my best friend L to become a police officer. If I ever cave into my cop friends?õ???? wishes and become a police officer, this event will have been a major point of inspiration.
Years later, at the Newark Police Precinct at the Oliver Street legal compound, I saw his face on a Newark?õ????s Most Wanted poster.
His charge? Armed robbery and
I cannot stress this enough:
Even if you don?õ????t carry, learning to disarm an attacker is an extremely valuable skill you?õ????ll never regret not having until its too late to do a damn thing about it.
Barring that, there are many ways to talk yourself out of a potentially dangerous situation. All it takes is some basic understanding of psychology, a little situational awareness, and common sense. This should always be your #1 go-to tactic. I?õ????ve walked away from encounters with knife and gun-wielding aggressors without lifting a finger. They didn?õ????t even know I had a knife, pepperspray, or bludgeon accessible.
Also, hammers make great weapons. Saved my ass during a carjacking where the perps had blades and who knows what else. Screwdrivers, hammers, chisels, wrenches, a pan, a pipe, a walking cane?õ???? If its solid or has an edge, you can defend yourself with it. It may look or seem silly at first, but you?õ????re welcome to train with a variety of tools and figure out how to use them effectively if god-knows-what ever happens. Home invasion, robbery, sexual assault, terrorist, whatever. If there?õ????s a guy with an assault rifle, you can be damn sure I?õ????m going to figure out a way to ram a screwdriver or letter opener into his carotid artery, exposed armpit, crease of their knee/elbow, eyeball, or bash their temple with a friggin?õ???? paperweight.
Way I see it is, when innocent lives are on the line, and the shit hits the fan, anything is a weapon and running is not an option. Grab a knife, sharpen the end of one of those little hair combs with the long thin handle, and see if that doesn?õ????t poke a hell of a hole in a mattress, drywall, or similar flesh-substitute. Now imagine if that?õ????s a bad guy?õ????s throat, eyeball, or what have you. See what I mean?
Clue was *not* joking about those murderous candle holders in the dining room, man.

"Which political ideology will make someone rich, communism or capitalism?"	"An ideology will not make you rich. A bum living on the street who honestly believes in capitalism will not magically wake up in a mansion the next morning as the CEO of BumCorp Ltd.
Which political economy (i.e. capitalist or communist) will lead you to riches is also strongly dependent on how you define ?õ????rich?õ???ù. Capitalism concentrates wealth in the hands of a minority, communism makes all wealth the common property of society (in theory- no large-scale communist society has ever yet existed). In a capitalist society, you could get lucky and become insanely rich a la Bill Gates or George Soros, or you could end up scrabbling to work two lousy minimum wage jobs or worse.
Under communism, you would have the means of satisfying all your needs, but only to the same extent as everyone else in society. This could mean a very good standard of living but it is not going to create Bill Gates-type people. The other problem with communism is that it largely remains a theoretical construct with no large-scale working models to study.
The third alternative, social democracy, uses socialisation and decommodification to achieve societies that are moderately egalitarian but also enable individuals to pursue personal enrichment if that appeals to them. The best social democracies, such as Sweden, ensure that everyone is wealthy but also enables some individuals to become even richer if they so desire. Capitalism remains a major part of the economic system, but its worst tendencies to concentrate wealth are offset by redistributive social policies and strong, highly empowered labour unions.

Why are Taylor guitars considered to be the best?	"They are not considered to
I believe this claim rose from owners of Taylor guitars, praising of their versatility of sound from different models. The quality of their guitar is also superb and the consistency with their sound throughout the years is astounding.
I, myself, own a Taylor 714-CE from 2011. It stills sounds as beautiful with its light tone since the day I?õ????ve purchased it! Something amazing to note is that Taylor caters to those seeking to buy their first ?õ????decent?õ???ù guitar as well. If you compare the sound of the 714-CE, a $3,000 priced guitar, with its predecessor, the 414-CE, a $1,800 priced guitar, the sounds are very similar. In fact, it?õ????s still hard for me to distinguish between the two!
I believe Martin, Gibson, and Larrivee all make great guitars. But the tonality and the frailty of a Taylor guitar, they have yet to match. The rich and vibrant tone of the Taylor, to me, feels superior!
I might be a bit biased considering I own one, but believe me when I say that Taylor is among the best!

What do statisticians (e.g. Stats PhD's) think of data scientists in industry without stats backgrounds?

About a year ago I had quite a deep conversation with a person with CS + ML academic background. To him data science was machine learning with big data. As long as I had a script that fitted a model and as long as the methodology involved training and test sets, cross validation and Hadoop, it was data science.
The problem here is not data science?õ???? it?õ????s science. According to my Facebook fee (and yours too I bet!) almost everyone loves science. Unfortunately almost no one understands what it actually is including people claiming to do data science. With the exception of dashboards, every single piece of my work is based on hypothesis testing. To me it is irrelevant if my model is a brilliantly built one if I can?õ????t test the hypothesis that using that model changes a predefined variable.
And this one I have to give it to statisticians and ?õ????pure?õ???ù data analysts. There are tons of misused statistics and a profound misunderstanding of what science and hypothesis testing is. I know it because I?õ????ve done it way before claiming we were a data science team!
I?õ????ve heard from people with academic backgrounds strongly based on statistics, some of them with research under their belts that it is the same thing with different names. They are partially right. As
The reason why I don?õ????t fully agree is because it is very difficult to see ?õ????data?õ???ù as a field like physics or biology. It makes it even harder when domain knowledge is a factor. For instance, if my domain is multiplayer mobile video games, then how come my field is data? And how exactly am I applying the scientific method to data outside the context of my domain?
And this is where things start to get really really fuzzy. On one hand the real nitty gritty scientific research is in fact in the computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data fields. On the other hand I?õ????m doing it in my domain only right?
Not really?õ???? every time I build a data product I?õ????m using knowledge and tools statisticians and data analyst don?õ????t have or use. For instance a statistician or data analyst can design, run and analyse many of the experiments we do in our games with some basic knowledge of them. But they cannot build a data product that does this in parallel on thousands of possibilities over millions of daily users.
It is when these two fields merge that data science appears and I don?õ????t think that people that are upset with the term ?õ????data science?õ???ù understand where ?õ????science?õ???ù fits or if they do they don?õ????t accept it.
I?õ????m not judging, just stating it.
This all boils down to a lack of definition of the scope of data science. Depending on where that definition lays in the future, the term might even be incorrect if ?õ????science?õ???ù loses ground.
I personally blame the unicorn data scientist of a couple of years ago and how the corporate world and job markets reacted to the media hype. It is getting better though, even if still very heterogeneous which naturally doesn?õ????t help.
However both sides have a lot to win if properly exposed to the ?õ????other?õ???ù side. I personally believe that in some years there won?õ????t be a difference between the two. The young generation fresh out of college that I?õ????m interviewing for entry positions nowadays certainly don?õ????t see the difference. They are still better statisticians than programmers for instance and I think that is a good thing.

My girlfriend thinks Donald Trump is an idiot and constantly insults him even though she knows I am a diehard supporter. Should I break up with her?	"Chances are you two have a lot of philosphical differences in the way you view the world. I would suggest that you not discuss Trump, but rather discuss issues and figure out what you both agree and disagree on. Obviously, she has a right to think anyone is an idiot, and many people do view Trump as being an idiot. Yet, there are many people on the other side, such as yourself.
Here is a list of topics to discuss to get to the root of the matter:
The bottom line is you two will probably never convince one another to change your opinion of old 45. He?õ????s a polarizing figure and it makes sense relationships are being tested. Relationships are a lot of work, and if there?õ????s something there worth fighting for, then you will have discourse, but still be able to keep your emotions out of it. You may find she has some valid points, Trump has done some very idiotic things, but I suppose we all have. She may also find that you have legitimate reasons for being a ?õ????diehard?õ???ù supporter of Trump. Your distinct worldviews are a result of everything you?õ????ve gone through from birth until now. Looking at the situation as if neither one of you is right or wrong is probably a great place to start. Good luck.

Will there be a serious Islamist political party in Europe this century?	"In Europe as a whole? No. There simply is no cultural basis for any Islam
European countries with historically established Muslim populations: Turkey, Albania, Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and non-European regions of Russia and former Soviet republics obviously have different cultural dynamics at play. Even in such places, the most likely outcome is the rise of Islamic Democratic parties that resemble the Christian Democratic parties of the rest of Europe. That is, it is done for marketing purposes rather than out of a desire to reorganize society along religious lines. European political parties have traditionally organized along economic or class interests, and there is no compelling evidence that would suggest that that is going to change in the foreseeable future.

Why do people quantify everything?	"Human beings are creatures of habit, and we like to have everything wrapped up in a handy, understandable little box. We use numbers to measure everything - minutes, years, income, intelligence, success, failure, attractiveness, etc. We're competitive, and use these numbers to determine our success in life by comparing them to other's numbers. It makes things easier to compare when we have specific numbers to use.
Why? Well humans have always judged themselves and others based on what they have, what they've done, etc. It's just human nature.
Another way to look at it:
We quantify everything because it's easy, and everyone else is already doing it. We love to be able to judge someone or something with a glance.
Think about an HR department in a large company. They advertise for a position. They list the requirements to land the job: years of experience, level of schooling, starting pay, the dates that they will start and stop accepting applicants, and so on. They get stacks of r?ü??sum?ü??s that they have to weed through, and they can quickly toss out anyone who doesn't meet the criteria, though most unqualified people wouldn't send in a r?ü??sum?ü??, knowing that they didn't meet the standards for hire.
Now imagine that same company posts a job opening and had no preset requirements at all. The volume of r?ü??sum?ü??s would increase exponentially, and few would be tossed out immediately because there was no way to quantify their ability to do the job. HR would have to slog through reading every r?ü??sum?ü?? and conducting many, many interviews. They could, and frequently would, absolutely still end up hiring the wrong person, but trial and error would be the only way to select new hires. So much time would be spent slaving over who to hire, and the whole process, from posting the job to actually hiring an applicant, could be lengthy.
For the most part, the first way is simply how most companies hire professionals. No one really questions it, because it just makes sense - if the numbers add up, a candidate applies and is considered. It's quicker and easier.
This scenario really fits almost any situation in which we use something quantifiable, something structured, to make life easier and more efficient.
That is my idea of the major reason we quantify everything. It makes dealing with life easier.
The problem with doing things the orderly way is that someone often falls through the cracks or is overlooked simply because they don't fit into the strict mold that society has established. Taking the hiring scenario as an example, let's say single dad Joe is a self-taught programmer, extremely skilled with a natural ability to pick up any code and understand it. He'd dearly love a coding job but can't take the time/can't afford to get the degrees and certifications required to even apply for any good positions, and he can't afford to take a pay cut just to get his foot in the door somewhere that he could work his way up.
Perhaps we should stop quantifying everything and be more open-minded. Evaluating people for who they are instead of judging them by what can be plugged into a spreadsheet or disregarding them simply because their skills and knowledge can't be immediately quantified with a glance.

Are there any games beside Mass Effect where your choices have huge story implications?	"Almost all Bioware RPGs gives players choices that impact the game in meaningful ways. Bioware and its spiritual predecessor Black Isle (?) are kind of famous for this. Both Bioware's flagship franchise, Mass Effect and Dragon Age, give players multiple opportunities to make meaningful choices both in main plot line and companion plot lines.
And there's Bethesda Games: Fall out franchise and Elder scroll Franchise. If you can get through the buggy game and hideous character models, Fall out 4 and Skyrim are great games with many meaningful choices you can make that impact the world.
Fable games also features meaningful choices. In Fable 2, the story continue across decades of time, you get to see how your early seemingly small decisions change the world in meaningful ways. Although, Fable games are really weak in character development, compare to other RPG games. It's still fun to play, but I found the relationship you have with your friends and the world around you is pretty weak.
There are other non-RPG games that features player choices which leads to one of the several endings. GTA 5 lets you decide which of the 3 main character you want to kill (or not kill). Deus Ex Human revolution and Mankind Divided allows players to make decisions through out the game and impact the ending. Bioshock games allows you to make decisions and impact games ending.
One last game I want to mention: Silent Hill 2. Still the best mind-fuck kind of game I have played over 2 decades. The game itself is pretty standard early 2000s style horror survival. The game (like many Japanese action adventure games at the time) features a few endings (and a few secret endings). But you (as James Sunderland) never explicitly make any black and white decision. There's no quick time event to choose, there's no dialogue options?õ???? The game track your actions (often seemingly insignificant and unconscious actions, such as look at an inventory items, check back a NPC you left behind?õ????), and through these actions, you get one of the endings. It's like 20 hour long psych eval. It's brilliantly done. I think original Bioshock came close, while the game has better stories, it doesn't match Silent Hill 2?õ???˝s execution.

"Considering Trump's frequent travel, is he a hypocrite for criticizing Obama for excessive travel expenses?"	"Yep.

Where will we go after death?	"Many Christians think of the soul as an immortal entity within us that goes on living after death. What does the Bible say? Describing the creation of human beings in the beginning, the Bible says, ?õ????And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul?õ???ù (
If souls existed as separate entities that lived on after we died, that would mean we have immortality. However, the Bible says human beings do not have immortality. Only God is immortal (see
Though we may die, Jesus says, ?õ????I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live?õ???ù (

The prophets never mention in the Bible that the righteous immediately go to heaven or the wicked go to hell when they die. Neither did Jesus and His apostles teach it. When Jesus was about to leave His disciples, He did not tell them they would soon come to Him. ?õ????Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father?õ????s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

When He returns, our loved ones asleep in Christ will awake from their tombs. No matter how long the time has passed, be it long or short, will seem but a moment to them. By the voice of Jesus, they are called forth from their deep slumber they will begin to think just where they ceased, awakening to a glorious immortality.
?õ????For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible?õ????So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written:

Visual Puzzles: What number is this car parked in?	"To get the answer, you just have to see this image by rotating 180 degree and you will get the answer.
Actually, I find this question easy because i did similar type of question in my childhood.
Puzzle Image-
This is three room puzzle. there are three rooms Room No.16, Room No. 17, Room No.18 and there is a thief who wants to steal all the diamonds, 2000 Rupee notes, and all the gold that is kept inside those rooms. When thief goes to the room no. 16 he steals everything and when he goes to the room no. 18 he steals everything without any problem. But, when he tried to enter the room no. 17 he couldn?õ????t.
The Answer is same as of this question. you just have to reverse the image and you will see LION is sitting inside that room.

What do I do if somebody called me an alcoholic?	"Let me just get this straight. Someone called you an alcoholic because you were wearing a hood, like a sweatshirt hood? That's like calling someone a terrorist because they have red shoes on. In other words, the insult doesn't even correlate with the reasoning for the insult. Pay no attention to someone ignorant enough to make random insults, especially if their poor insults don't even make sense.
Perhaps, you should explore why being called an alcoholic upset you so much. Does alcoholism run in your family? Have you been hurt by someone who is an alcoholic? Do you possibly consider yourself to be an alcoholic? Why did they relate the hood to alcoholism in your case?
These are all reasonable questions and concerns. Some self exploration could help answering the prior questions and perhaps help you cope next time you come across someone as ignorant as this.
I suppose I'll specifically answer the question now, so it doesn't get collapsed. There's a few things you can do:
You can insult them back, it may make you feel better at first, but you'll probably still fester on their insult later on.
You can say nothing back and still ponder the insult.
My response would probably be something to the effect of, ?õ????What does that even mean??õ???ù Use their ignorance against them and then if it hurt you that bad, just don't talk to them again because that's not someone you want to be around for numerous reasons.
Good luck!

But believing something just because it feels right, or because it is what I was taught, or because a figure of authority or an ancient book or hearsay says so, just does not fit inside an atheist's head. We cannot help it.

I also checked previous years jee advanced toppers and there was only one person in the top 100 in iitg region. :( I believe staying here won't do any good and coaching here would just be a waste of money(tell me if I'm wrong). That's where I need help. Should I just move to Kota like everyone? Should I stay here and learn from online resources? (I live in university quarters and I have pretty fast internet) I've learned most of the class 10 concepts from online resources. (shitty school). Also I should mention I'll be an st candidate if I appear.
My parents are supportive but they are in the arts so they're not able to provide any insight. :(

Have you succeeded in meditation?	"You say you gave up but were you doing it correctly? It is, after all, the direct pursuit of happiness [the common human goal]; one that does not depend on external objectives.

We practice that in meditation
We meditate to benefit practically from that understanding so that it will eventually infiltrate our daily lives.
I began meditating in my late teens and continued , intermittently, until in I had a mild satori [dissociation of awareness from its normal activities] at twenty seven years of age. From that moment on I understood what it was all about and could really get down to the job.

However all cricket fans from the subcontinent are perpetual masochists. We watch irrespective of being able to predict the result.
However I have great heartfelt warmth for several Indian and Pakistani players who are actually good friends off the field or have great respect for each other due to them sharing language and culture.

What was the most amusing conversation that you have ever heard?	"Once upon a time I was a touring musician. Often the crew (lights, sound, loaders, etc.) are musicians also, just not on the level of the musicians performing on the big stage that particular evening. They love the scene, they love the touring, and they like to eat.
But of course they?õ????d rather be playing.
Before the show, I was standing back by the soundboard listening to two of the lighting crew talking about their band. It was interesting to me so I just kind of hung out pretending to look at the sound board, saying in ear shot of their conversation. It?õ????s also a good way to learn if your crew is about to quit unexpectedly because their own band just got a break.
The big guy?õ????s name was ?õ????Red?õ???ù as every red haired crew guy is called - unless he?õ????s HUGE in which case he might be called ?õ????Tiny.?õ???ù He was a big strong guy so his nickname could have gone either way. The other guy?õ????s name was Troy as he was fairly new and we hadn?õ????t thought of a playful nickname for him yet that stuck.
So Red and Troy were talking and I was slyly listening, sipping a beer which somehow, magically, makes a person less visible in a band situation. I think a musician?õ????s brain is trained to prioritize visual things. It?õ????s subconscious; ?õ????Oh, that?õ????s a guy with a beer.?õ???ù Those are everywhere. Not a cop, not a hot girl, completely unimportant.
I learned that Red and Troy were in a band together. Red was the drummer and I assumed Troy was a guitarist as he didn?õ????t talk like a bassist and had never struck me as a singer as he didn?õ????t seem to have the ego for it, nor did he seem quiet and analytical as a keyboardist might.
They were discussing a show they?õ????d just been asked to play. Troy had that poker faced but suspicious and dreading look that guitarists get when the drummer has come up with an idea.
The camouflage beer was working as they seemed to be paying me no attention at all. I allowed myself a slight smile and edged a little closer.
Red was telling Troy that he?õ????d booked their band a gig. Troy was looking apprehensive. He said, ?õ????Are we ready for that? Does it pay? Where? When?
Red replied, ?õ????Just three hours. We have a week to get ready for it.?õ???ù
Troy about came out of his shoes. ?õ????How the f*ck can we play a three hour show? We?õ????d need to learn 40 songs!?õ???ù
Red replied, in complete seriousness, ?õ????Come on dude, we can do this. That?õ????s just ten songs each.?õ???ù
I laughed so hard that I spilled my beer, fortunately not on the mixing console.

Do most photographers use Lightroom?	"Well, as a full-time photographer I do, and I think most photographers
I do all my editing in LR, and I do all my asset-management in LR, as I do all my production out of LR.
photographers who say that LR is too simple are invariably photographers who do not know Lightroom well. When I show a photographer Lightroom they are always convinced. Lightroom is incredibly flexible, does not force you to choose RAW conversion parameters at the beginning, and of course if you need edits that cannot be done in lightroom you could always pop into Photoshop from within Lightroom. That's happened to me only once last year.
To each his own, but do investigate Lightroom seriously. You will find it will save you 80% of your post production time

Do I have to consider people if I have no benefit?	"Of course not.
However, it may not hurt to ask yourself a few questions first.
Would you like for other people to consider you, regardless of whether it benefits them?
What if you are in a pinch? Lost? Broken down? Broke? Sick?
Would you hope people might consider your plight, rather than just shrugging it off as ""no benefit"" for them?
Think about if no one ever helped others without ensuring their own gain first. Does that sound like a world you would want to live in?
There are no correct or incorrect answers here. However, it is worth considering that a bit of empathy can go a long ways towards creating a better world to live in, for yourself and for others.

Why are rich countries rich and poor countries poor?	"Countries interact in exactly the same way that individuals interact.
At the micro level (individuals) negotiate and fight for dominance over their own peers. Some strike better deals and end up millionaires. Others con and bamboozle their way to the top. Others simply rob and plunder.
Countries (macro level) do exactly the same. The west started off by pillaging and plundering. Then they established a currency system whereby they ?õ????pretend?õ???ù to buy goods and resources from poorer countries by giving them heaps of papers printed with emblems of their own country?õ????s heritage and in exchange the poorer country releases its coal,gold, fruits and timber among other resources. The poor country then makes a trip to the rich country that gave them the paper to spend the paper money inside that country by buying processed goods that were made possible by the resources that it initially ?õ????sold?õ???ù to that rich country.
You can view this as some large con game or some daft negotiations by the resource rich countries who exchange real goods for printed paper simply because of a world system that tells them that they can?õ????t buy trinkets from the West unless they are carrying the appropriate paper currency.
Take a look at all the countries currently locked in some frivolous war and getting undeserved attention from the west ( all those countries are resource-rich) but their citizens go without food or peace for decades.
I made a general summary of how it all starts, you may be able to expand these basic reasons into many interpretations of what?õ????s going on around the world that leaves other countries perpetually poor.

A guy who had crush on me 2 years back but he never approached me now he is in touch with me between he had 2 girl friends?	"It?õ????s possible that 2 years ago he was too afraid to approach you.
I?õ????m not saying this is what happened, but let?õ????s imagine that a year and a half ago, he could ask two girls out. One was you and the other was his first girlfriend. Logically, he should ask out the one he likes better, right?
Not necessarily. If he asks out the one he likes less, and she rejects him, then he hasn?õ????t lost anything of importance, and has learned one way to not ask a girl out. If he asks out the one he really likes, and she rejects him, the loss is devastating.
Let?õ????s imagine he asked out the girl that was less important to him, and she surprised him by saying ?õ????yes?õ???ù. Well, at this point he?õ????s not going to say, ?õ????Oh, well, I didn?õ????t really mean it and certainly wasn?õ????t expecting you to agree to out with me . . .?õ???ù No, he asked her out, so they?õ????re going out. They go out, they like it, they date for a while, eventually they part ways. Now he thinks, that was easier than expected. I wonder if dating is always that easy. So, he asks another girl out. And she shocks the hell out of him when she says ?õ????yes?õ???ù. (Remember, as guys, we are taught that if we ask a girl out, we WILL BE REJECTED.)
So, they date, and she becomes his second girlfriend.
Now, he?õ????s figured out this dating thing. So now he sees his ultimate goal - YOU.
Remember, you don?õ????t run the Boston Marathon if you?õ????ve never run before. First you run a mile. Then you work your way to a half-marathon. Then you work your way up to a full marathon. THEN you?õ????re ready for the Boston.
You don?õ????t decide to climb Mount Everest if you?õ????ve never done any mountain climbing before. You work your way up to it.
You do that for ANY loft goal.
Now, imagine that YOU are the lofty goal, the unattainable, the impossible dream. But, he has just passed two trials - two subgoals to prove himself able to try for the grand prize.
And when he reaches for you, you indicate that you?õ????re not sure you want to date someone who had 2 other girlfriends.
You stated you had feelings for him. Did you ever ask him out, or did you lay ALL THE PRESSURE ON HIM?
Imagine that he was afraid of being rejected if he asked you out before he knew what he was doing , and then gets rejected for learning what to do before asking you out.
It?õ????s possible that that?õ????s the situation you just described.

Is it possible to use the drive in windows which is allocated for Ubuntu?	"I?õ????ll be fast to answer this,
Windows uses entirely different file system called NTFS where as linux uses file system called ext3 or ext4.
Understand file system as method to format hard drive and make cluster for data and information about cluster structure should be understandable by operating system before it can access that specific formatted area of hard drive.
Quick Reference :
Look at the file system of your Ubuntu partition. Windows cannot hardly recognize other file systems than NTFS and FAT32. So if your Ubuntu partition is not NTFS nor FAT32 (the installer proposes ext4 by default I think), Windows will not likely recognize your partition since it does not know its file system. However, there are some softwares on Windows to see other file systems.
So technically, its not pre-defined in windows environment to read those section of hard drive.
Ext2Fsd is a Windows file system driver for the Ext2, Ext3, and Ext4 file systems. It allows Windows to read Linux file systems natively, providing access to the file system via a drive letter that any program can access.
It?õ????s an open-source application that works similarly to DiskInternals Linux Reader ?õ???? but only for Ext4, Ext3, and Ext2 partitions. It also lacks file previews, but it has one advantage: it doesn?õ????t have to be installed; you can just download the .exe and run it.

Why are silencers illegal if all they do is bring the noise level down to a level that won't cause hearing loss?	"I only going to answer for the US and primarily Montana and states with similar laws.
In general a firearms silencer is not illegal (some states have execptions to this). They are however very heavily regulated. To own a silencer you need to complete and submit a Form 1 or Form 4 and submit it to the ATF along with a passport photo and a set of fingerprint cards. You also have to pay the $200 tax for NFA items. One you have your returned Form 1 or Form 4 you can make or purchase your silencer. This process takes about 6?õ????12 months depending upon current wait times and other factors.
Now as to why are they so heavily regulated when all they really do is reduce the noise to a more hearing safe level. It mostly has to do with prohibition and gangsters. Some people wanted to make it harder for criminals to get certain items (sound familar) and decide that the best course of action was to basically make it impossible for your average gun owner at the time to own those items. So they imposed a waiting period, background check, photo and finger print submittion, and the $200 tax. Now as to whether or not silencers where a heavily used criminal item I have no idea but based off current trends I?õ????d say no because

Why is Harry so angsty and sassy in Order of the Phoenix?	"Read this, and think about it. This is from Tumblr.
Harry?õ????s anger in OotP is important because it?õ????s a response to a violation of his boundaries, a breach of trust?õ????and in many ways, a response to boundary violations that began during his abusive childhood. The way the Dursleys treated Harry early in the series? massive boundary violation. they didn?õ????t respect him as a person, didn?õ????t acknowledge his needs, didn?õ????t allow him belongings, restricted his access to food, took away correspondence that belonged to him, denied him important information not just about his family but also about his personal safety.
The way they?õ????re treating him in OotP? still a massive boundary violation. again, denying him access to information (he has to lie under the window to hear the news), restricting his access to food, and also physically abusing him on at least one occasion (Vernon grabs him around the throat, and Harry doesn?õ????t even seem surprised).
Harry has had a right to anger for a long time. but the only time he really expressed that, even inadvertently, (the incident with Marge in PoA), he was punished for it by the people he trusted. overall, it?õ????s made very clear to Harry that he?õ????s not supposed to express anger at the Dursely?õ????s the end of GoF and the beginning of OotP, however, Harry experiences some massive boundary violations within the wizarding world: the discovery that a teacher he trusts is actually a Death Eater working to kill him, the loss of meaningful contact with his friends over the summer as he deals with what?õ????s probably PTSD, and the threat of losing all access to Hogwarts because he defended himself and Dudley.
The wizarding world, despite its physical dangers, has been Harry?õ????s emotional haven. he has so far been safer there than with his relatives, because he receives validation, is allowed to have human needs, and can trust others to have some concern for his well-being. however, with these three violations, things begin to change. Barty Crouch pretend to care about Harry, then leads him to Voldemort.
Dumbledore forbids anyone to give him information over the summer, which sends the message that the struggle he?õ????s experiencing isn?õ????t important. and the Ministry tries to expel him from Hogwarts for self-defence, which is a clear indication that his needs (even in life-or-death situations) aren?õ????t important to them. At this point, Harry is already really angry. it?õ????s a valid reaction. in fact, it?õ????s a warning sign. he?õ????s being told his safety and happiness don?õ????t matter, and that?õ????s a dangerous position to be in.
And then Umbridge comes into the picture.
Umbridge doesn?õ????t just deny him access to information; she imposes her will over the information he already has. she displays open favoritism. she?õ????s physically abusive, and in fact forces Harry to enact that harm on himself. she punishes the students for learning how to defend themselves, despite the fact that this is supposed to be part of their curriculum. Everything she does sends the same message to Harry that the Dursleys have been sending him since he was a kid: what he has to say doesn?õ????t matter, his safety isn?õ????t important, and he should never stand up for himself.
The difference is, she?õ????s communicating all these things in the very place Harry has come to associate with safety, so it?õ????s an even greater violation. (in addition, Harry?õ????s trust is betrayed by Dumbledore, who consistently denies him information and is absent when Harry needs him, such that Harry gets the impression he needs to handle everything alone, and isn?õ????t willing to tell Dumbledore about Umbridge?õ????s abuse. And then there?õ????s Snape, with the Occlumency lessons, literally forcing his way into Harry?õ????s mind and mocking him for being unable to stop it, and I could write another whole post on that.)
Basically, Harry?õ????s anger in OotP is important to me because it validates that emotional response to abusive boundary violations. Does he always use that anger wisely? no. but he tries, and he grows, and he?õ????s a person and he?õ????s been massively betrayed and that matters, it matters to me because I?õ????ve been abused and it matters just in general because the world needs to know anger doesn?õ????t necessarily mean people are evil or dark. sometimes, it just means they need to be listened to.
And I think above and beyond all of this also is the consideration that Harry?õ????s being patronised by the adults about battles that he has fought the information is being withheld from him under the presumption that he?õ????s just another child. When he isn?õ????t when he has never been he?õ????s prepared himself to go and die in battle in Gof he literally is returned to the field crying over Cedric?õ????s body he has seen the costs and wounds of the war just as the adults have. All the while internalising all of everyone?õ????s crap that he is the only one who can save it, because he is the only person to have survived. Everyone knows he needs to be the one to fight at the end of the day and he?õ????s still not being given any information because he?õ????s a child and he doesn?õ????t deserve the seat at the war room table yet. Which is untrue and unfair and which he finds untrue and unfair and this is the book when the threat of war and Voldemort's resurgence is really heavy and still here the adults are saying, just sit still Harry, just wait another minute Harry, just go to school Harry, we?õ????ll take care of it everything?õ????s fine. This is the first time when instead of agreeing to it Harry fights for his place he fights for his voice and he fights specifically for his voice to be heard as equally as the adults are.

I?õ????m usually a pretty observant person, but half of the time when I think that a girl has done something to change her appearance, it turns out that I?õ????m either way too late to the party, or just having a hallucination.
This happened in French class today:
I walked into the classroom, and I noticed that the cute girl (I mean the gorgeous fucking babe) who sits next to me got blond highlights in her brown hair. I thought it looked cool, and I thought that this little detail would make for a good excuse to start a conversation with her:

Can blue eyed parents have a brown eyed child?	"No, but it can work the other way. Blue is a recessive allele and requires 2, one in the gamete from each parent, to show up, that is the phenotype. But people with brown eyes are showing the dominant allele even if they carry the hidden one for blue.
For instance, my grandmother had blue eyes, grandfather had brown. They had 2 kids, one with brown eyes and one with blue. That means my grandfather had 1 recessive blue eye allele And 1 dominat brown, so his phenotype was for brown. My grandmother had 2 recessive blue alleles, so her phenotype was blue.
the brown eyed child had kids with both brown and blue eyes because her partner was blue eyed and she'd inherited a blue from grandma. The blue eyed child had all blue eyed children because her partner was blue eyed. Had her partner displayed the brown phenotype, and one of his parents had blue, the kids would have been optionally mixed phenotype brown or recessive phenotype blue.
So, blue eyed can only contribute blue alleles and brown MAY donate brown or blue IF the brown eyed parent has a parent with blue eyes.
Wow, that was a long way of saying no.

Who has the power to literally shut down the internet?	"No single person can shutdown the internet. There are bodies in charge of the internet who design new protocols and stuff but no single person can flip a switch to shut it down.
But, a small group of people can cause significant outages with the internet. Internet Service Providers (ISP's) such as Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, etc are in charge of a lot of the U.S?õ????s internet. If they shut down their services, a majority of the United States citizens would lose internet.
This would also bleed over to websites that are hosted in the United States. Because people from other countries would not be able to connect to those servers, because the servers would be essentially disconnected from what's left on the internet.
Of course, the ISPs would never do this because they'd lose millions of dollars.

How easy is it to get a job at Boeing or Airbus if we have a PhD in Aerospace Engineering?	"I remember when I was working supporting Northrop on the B-2A bomber program.
There was a PhD engineer at Northrop who had a twin brother at Boeing who also had a PhD.
Neither knew that the other was working on the B-2A development program.
One day I was walking down the hallway with the Northrop brother and here comes his twin from the other direction?õ?????õ????..
?õ????Bob, is there a mirror in the hallway or is there something that you need to tell us??õ???ù, I said.
Now that was a wonderful family reunion in the hallways of Pico Rivera.
If you have a PhD in a niche aerospace area that is of interest to Boeing or to Airbus it should be very easy to get a job.
It will be Much easier if, along with that PhD, you are either an US citizen (Boeing) or a citizen of an EU country (Airbus).
All the best, and may you also have a wonderful reunion with a family member at work.

"What is the smartest street billboard ad you have ever seen, or looked at and liked a lot?"	"That's what an adult would read on this billboard.
A child would however see a slightly different message. A second sentence appears:
Along with the foundation's phone number.
Bruises and injuries appear on the boy?õ????s face.
This billboard used lenticular printing to show two different images depending on the height of the person reading it.
A great example of extremely powerful and clever advertising.
It makes us literally see from a child?õ????s perceptive that ?õ????""Sometimes child abuse is only visible to the child suffering it?õ???ù.
It doubles as both an ad for the help line and an awareness campaign for us adults.
Because child abuse does happen, but we adults don't notice it as much as we could.
It got people talking that child abuse is a very real thing that happens behind closed doors more often than we'd like to think.
It helped children understand what they could do to protect themselves.
The message reached a massive audience.
Newspapers picked up the story. Schools showed this ad to kids. People shared it on Facebook. It went viral and has been seen millions and millions of times.
It made people aware. And acknowledging that a problem exists is the first step to solving a problem.

How much is a van Gogh painting worth?	"I would think that a good-sized, late in his career, bright-colored oil painting in his most characteristic expressive style, properly signed, should sell at auction in 2017 for $50 million to $100 million.
However, you might well be able to buy a very good Van Gogh painting in the $5 million range. It would be smaller, a bit darker, maybe the subject is not quite as attractive. Or the sale day was not so great. It could be something as mundane as the weather, or bad news in some part of the world that distracted potential buyers. A potential $10 million painting could sell for $5 million if one of the two most eager bidders is out of the market. He was hassled at the airport by Homeland Security arriving from Dubai and was irritated enough to turn around and pull his bid and go home on auction day.
And an unsigned oil or a watercolor could sell for a lot less. Maybe as little as $500,000 in 2017.
And then there are the misfits. The very dark or the very small or the very early Van Gogh paintings, or the very unlovely subjects. Or something for sale at a smaller auction house.
You might pick up one of the misfits for as little as $200,000. And once in awhile, that misfit has some quality that makes it great after all. Paintings always look better when you own them.
When you spend enough money on something, your brain finds a way to see its best qualities all over again.
Here?õ????s my pick for the best cheap Van Gogh painting. It?õ????s a watercolor that sold for about $500,000 in 2014. It?õ????s an 1886 painting of the scene outside the artist?õ????s studio window.

How do I overcome so many restrictions on me?	"Look, we are not just an individual but rather we in this world play many different roles such as a husband, a father or a son. And every role of ours has its own responsibilities and expectations.
Maybe the things you consider restrictions are just the concern of those respective people for you. Since you no longer live with your wife, why are you hurting yourself by remembering how she used to bound you.
Your family-if your family tells you not to do something, maybe because they are concerned for you, they love you and want you to go in the right direction. This is just their way of showing that they love you and care for you.
But if there are things that you really wanna do, and you know they won?õ????t be wrong for you(since you are old enough), try making your family understand your feelings. Don?õ????t do it by hurting them. Its important in life to pursue what you actually want but family should be the first priority and should never be hurt. Make the relationship between you and your family a tranparent one. Don?õ????t insult them by doing what they do not want you to do, neither hurt yourself by killing your ambitions and desires. Have a mutual understanding. Make the relationship with your family a healthy one. Sit together with them, explain them how their concerns are coming in the way of your ambitions. Have a healthy discussion. They are your family and will surely understand you.
Hope it helps!

What is something you often ate as a child that you now find revolting?	"I would like to start out with ginger ale and lime sherbet, both of which I associate with being sick as a kid.
I had always thought ginger ale was okay, I guess, but I never had a real affinity for it. It was, however, a common treatment of upset stomachs in our house when I was growing up. 7-Up would do in a pinch if ginger ale wasn?õ????t wasn?õ????t available (and to this day I don?õ????t much care for it, either), but ginger ale was
Now, lime sherbet was a horse of a different color. It was one of my absolute favorite desserts as a kid. I loved the stuff. Loved, loved, loved it! Whenever I got sick, Mom would give me some lime sherbet as a special treat. It was cool and soothing on a hot, scratchy throat, it rested easy on an upset stomach and it was delicious. And came the day I hit the wall. I still vividly remember that day more than 50 years later. I was home from school with some kind of bug. I was laying on the couch when Mom brought me a glass of ginger ale and a bowl of lime sherbet. I dug into my lime sherbet with my usual enthusiasm. I don?õ????t know what kind of horrible ailment was afflicting me, but the more lime sherbet I ate, the sicker I felt. Finally, about halfway through, I simply could not take any more and set the bowl on the coffee table. I spent the next couple of hours watching the leftover lime sherbet melt into a viscous, light green, gooey bowlful of yuck. I began playing with it, dragging the spoon through that mess, scooping some up and watching it drip back into the bowl, until I suddenly had to make a mad dash to the bathroom and puke my guts out. Yikes! Now I had a
After many years of avoidance, I have since reacquired my taste somewhat for ginger ale. I only drink it a few times a year, usually at social events where I?õ????m a designated driver or simply don?õ????t feel like imbibing alcohol. However, I have yet to bring myself to trying lime sherbet again, or any sherbet for that matter. Occasionally when I?õ????m scavenging for ice cream at the store, I will linger in front of the sherbets and consider giving lime sherbet another try, but she was my first true love and she hurt me so badly that I?õ????m still not over her.
My final two nominees are Vienna sausages and potted meat product. Vienna sausages are little canned pink sausages that another answer correctly describes as resembling erect dog dicks. I think they are made from the stuff that is deemed not good enough to use in hot dogs. Potted meat product is this stuff that kinda resembles pink library paste, but not nearly as tasty. I?õ????m pretty sure it is made from the stuff that is deemed not good enough to use in Vienna sausages.
In the mid-1960s, we spent a couple of years in Stillwater, Oklahoma while my Dad worked on his PhD at Oklahoma State. During the course of our stay, Mom had to have surgery. I was told it was to remove some kidney stones. I remember her showing me her scar and to my kid?õ????s eye, it looked like they had sliced her open from navel to spine. In retrospect, it there may have been something more sinister going on because it seems like an awfully aggressive treatment for kidney stones, but I have no idea what was state-of-the-art medical technology in 1965. But then, why present kidney stones as a less scary alternative to a kid? I doubt I even knew what kidneys were back then. Unfortunately, both of my parents are gone,so I can?õ????t ask.
I was eight years old and in the third grade at the time and attending Will Rogers Elementary School. We loaded up Mom along with my brother David (age 5), my sister Macy (age 3) and my brother Rob (age 1) and carried them the four or five hours south to Dallas, where Mom had grown up and where her family still lived. They would stay there while Mom had her surgery and recuperated. Since Dad and I were both in school, we would stay in Stillwater.
I can?õ????t tell you if Mom and them were gone for two weeks or two months, I just remember it seeming like a very long time (in kid terms). It didn?õ????t matter to me. Dad and I were two wild and crazy guys living large in Stillwater, Oklahoma! And this is finally where the Vienna sausages and potted meat product come into play. We lived off the stuff. We ate Vienna sausages and potted meat product by the truckload and I loved every tasty can of it. Now, lest you judge my father as an unfit parent, he was concerned about me getting my vegetables in my formative years, so it wasn?õ????t all Vienna sausages and potted meat product. We washed it all down with V8 juice. Truckloads of Vienna sausages and potted meat product and gallons of V8 juice. I was in kid heaven!
I guess we overdid it because, 52 years later, I still cannot even look at a can of Vienna sausages or potted meat product without getting a little queasy. I don?õ????t recall seeing Dad eat much of either after that, either. Surprisingly, I never tired of the V8 juice and will still drink some on occasion.

How did David Keasal fly a Cessna 172 from the US to India?	"Thanks for the question. Preparation is everything. Overflight and landing permits, FAA stuff. Flight planning. If it were easy, everyone would do it. First, I did a thorough mechanical check on the airplane, and then flew it to work every day (I worked at an airport about 30 nm from where I lived) for a few days. I got ferry tanks welded up out of sheet steel, had them pressure checked, then installed them in the cabin. I designed the system to pump the ferry fuel from the ferry tanks into the right wing tank using electric pumps. I installed two electric pumps for redundancy, and used the fuel from the right tank to run the engine, leaving the left tank nearly full in case of a malfunction. The 172 feeds the carburetor by gravity, so a pump or electrical failure would still leave me the fuel remaining in the right tank plus the fuel in the left tank, which was nearly full all the time, since I only used it for takeoff. There was always enough fuel to reach land, even without pumps. I had the system inspected by an Authorized Inspector, then called the FAA for a ferry permit. This permit allowed me to fly the airplane at a weight well over legal max, and came with a bunch of restrictions. The electrical failure was the very thing that happened to my friend Roger Good in an identical airplane. He was the first one that I know of who flew the route, and his experience was not lost on me when I followed him, since I had prepped his airplane. His alternator failed over the North Atlantic, but he reached the first island in the Azores. He has another tale to tell about that trip.
So I had about 19 or 20 hours of fuel on board, flying at around 95 knots at the beginning, increasing to about 105 knots just before landing, when the airplane was lighter. I flew the following route: Toledo, Ohio to St. Johns, Newfoundland; St. Johns to Santa Maria, Azores; Santa Maria to Barcelona; Barcelona to Malta; Malta to Luxor, Egypt; Luxor to Dubai; Dubai to Mumbai; Mumbai to New Delhi; New Delhi to Jaipur. 85.5 hours total, an adventure every leg, so many interesting things happened. But that?õ????s for another day.

What is your review of CloudFuze?	"A few months ago, I took on a project that included moving video files from one server to another server. The servers are owned by different companies. The second server has a limit of 20gb upload per week. This part of the project will go on for several months.
This project is not huge, still, there is a weekly schedule that must be met to keep the project on schedule. CloudFuze handles this type and size of file movement easily. The process is from an amazon s3 server to a Dropbox account. From there files are uploaded individually and placed within a structure.
However, it is when something does not go as planned that a company?õ????s real value is felt and understood. Usually, this is a process of scheduling and routine migration. But what happens when one of the servers you are migrating to or from is not working correctly? Or CloudFuze has a glitch? For me, this is where CloudFuze shines.
If something goes awry at CloudFuze, they will discuss it with you and give you an honest appraisal of how your jobs might be affected. Honest is important here, their answers will affect my clients response to my decisions for them. If there is a problem somewhere else in the process, like one of the other servers, which happened yesterday, they will keep your jobs queued until the problem at the other end is cleared up. When it is, your job is sitting in the queue and ready to go. In minutes, for me, the problem became history and work flow was once again under way.
During problems, the staff and technical support is always right there, available and doing what they can to keep things progressing. They keep you apprised of changes in status so you don?õ????t have to worry that a problem turns into a nightmare because the right people are not right there with your job.
This is a bit long, but great service is what makes a company worth having in your corner when you are doing work for others. For those who want to know, this is an example of why I use and recommend CloudFuze.

Which MVC framework is best for PHP programming?	"These are the frameworks that are actively maintained, popular among developer community, promote modern web development practices and make it possible to build websites and web applications of all sizes and complexity.
Laravel is undisputedly the king of PHP frameworks and spans the widths and depths of large scale web application development. Laravel ecosystem has quickly grown huge with supportive community and boasts tons of free tutorials and learning resources to get you started within no time.
Laravel is built to be simple, easy to learn and supports rapid application development. You get rich set of features to bring any large scale project to life within days. Laravel comes with its own templating engine named ?õ????Blade?õ???ù. The best thing about Blade is that it allows you to write plain PHP in the templates which essentially means that Blade brings no performance overheads to your application.
Another power fact about
New to the world of Laravel or PHP development, no problems, there is a dedicated website named The Best Laravel and PHP Screencasts that hosts hundreds of PHP video tutorials. You can access the basic tutorials as well as most advanced ones to master Laravel at a very minimal cost.
Laravel team has recently released ?õ????Lumen?õ???ù, a micro PHP framework for the web developers who like to build lightning fast API?õ????s as well as Laravel based services.

Do you have a very complex and large scale enterprise project at hand? If yes, then Symfony 2 is the one framework to get your job done right. Symfony ecosystem as a whole consists of large set of reusable components, vibrant and active community, Symfony framework and a philosophy to take PHP to the next level.
Symfony framework gets all the super powers from the reusable and decoupled set of components it packs within. The power features of Symfony components can be guessed from the fact that even the big brother Laravel utilizes many of Symfony components.
Symfony components fuel some of the largest open source projects like Drupal, PHPBB, PIWIk, OROCRM and Laravel, to name a few. Symfony components also power one of the most popular templating engine named ?õ????Twig?õ???ù.
Symfony framework was first released back in 2005 as open source PHP framework by interactive agency Sensiolabs. Symfony framework is available under MIT license and can be downloaded from its github repository -

In Short, I would go for Laravel for large scale rapid application development even with lesser experienced resources, but, if it is about complex enterprise grade application development, my preference would shift towards Symfony, with more skilled developers.
Codeigniter is the one framework that has maintained itself well over the period of time, however, in recent times, it is seeming shaky against the modern and newly launched PHP frameworks. Codeigniter was created by Ellislab back in 2006 and made available to public for free use under MIT license.
Codeigniter has been the framework of choice for the reason that it was lightweight, fast as compared to other contemporary PHP frameworks and easier to learn. As of today, most of PHP beginners are attracted towards Laravel, Phalcon and even FuelPHP rather than Codeigniter.
Although, the framework has been among best of its times, ""IMHO"" the future ahead for Codeigniter doesn?õ????t look bright. Ellislab also doesn?õ????t seem to support it anymore and it is now fully in control of the community.

"If I have original plus ransomware encrypted file, can I still decrypt the infected file?"	"Depends, though it makes the process somewhat easier.
Typically, the problem is recovering malware keys as the encryption process is malware - specific and can be determined with relative ease by forensic.
If private keys are known (they are published for older malwares sometimes) or encryption process is faulty, you can decrypt all files without trying to determine the keys.
In other cases one will have to try all the keys matching length (encrypt original file/compare with infected) and that would take lots of computer time. In most of the cases it would not be feasible for regular data.

What are the best ways to care for a blue Indian ringneck parrot?	"Indian ring-necked parakeets are sensitive birds that need lots of play time and time out of the cage to remain happy; if not, expect your bird to develop neurotic disorders that many be very difficult to reverse.
Because of the long tail, Indian ring necks need a larger cage than another bird of the same relative size. Ring necks love their toys, and will hang on them and toss them around the cage, so be sure to have lots of toys on hand to replace the ones your bird destroys ?õ???? this type of destruction is a normal, healthy part of being a companion bird. If you can handle a good deal of chattering, some of it ear-piercing, and you have the time and energy to spend with this beautiful bird, consider welcoming an Indian ring-necked parakeet into your family.
Indian ring necks tend to have good appetites. As with any bird, make sure to feed a balanced, nutritious diet that includes pellets, fruit, veggies, and healthy table foods. This way you can be sure that your bird is nourished and will not become bored with his diet. These birds are reported to live for more than 30 years.

When will the United States' war with the Middle East end?	"Technically it already has done; there are no current US declarations of war with any Middle Eastern country. The US instead prefers to rely on the rather vague notion of a ?õ????War on Terror?õ???ù which, unsurprisingly, draws it into conflict with various Middle Eastern and African Islamist groups.
So to answer your question in the broader sense, we cannot say with any certainty when the Middle East and Africa will not be host to US troops.
Hopefully within the next year or two we will see an end to both the Iraqi and Syrian civil wars. New governments, and possibly new states may be formed (think Kurdistan in Northern Iraq/Syria and possibly a split Syrian territory) and relative stability will come to the region. Afghanistan is another question as the situation seems to be becoming worse by the day.
Stability will require a great deal of hard work and a great deal of money - large parts of Iraq and Syria are territories devoid of any functioning government institutions or infrastructure. Decades of war have taken their toll on Iraq?õ????s ability to function as a state and certain Syrian cities are completely devastated. Both countries?õ???? intellectual elite fled the countries long ago and the population is now largely devoid of anyone with peace time governmental experience. Once peace is achieved the Middle East will likely require a program of aid and development on the level of the European Marshal Plan after WWII. This will cost the world billions.
The major challenge is with finding a solution that addresses the wishes of all parties involved; there are hundreds of groups fighting in Iraq and Syria, each representing a population with their own beliefs, grievances and tribal affiliations. This is an almost impossible situation to manage and the hatred runs very deep between certain communities - there is a reason the Iraqi government tries to keep it?õ????s Shia militias out of liberated Sunni areas.
Another is finding a way to counter the extreme and violent culture that has taken hold of the regions people. Another almost impossible task given the decades of conflict and injustice. People do not forget when their father/brother/mother/cousin etc. was killed by a group they consider ?õ????the enemy?õ???ù and do not forgive simply because there has been an official end to the fighting. Intra-group and intra-tribal tensions will simmer for
So, with the above in mind, it seems a safe bet to suggest that the US will have troops stationed in the Middle East for a very, very long time, even after a relative peace is brokered.
If Germany or Europe in general can be used as a precedent, they may well never leave.

"What is the difference between quantum entanglement and ""spooky action at a distance""?"	"Quantum Entanglement refers to a specific set of phenomena which are known to occur within quantum mechanics, both theoretically and experimentally. Specifically, it refers to a situation where the entire quantum state of a physical system cannot be factored into a nice clean product of two states, each describing separate isolated systems.
The phrase ?õ????spooky action at a distance?õ???ù only really makes sense in the somewhat fringe Hidden Variables set of interpretations of quantum mechanics. It?õ????s not something that occurs in any mainstream version of quantum mechanics.
The phrase is correctly attributed to Einstein, although he only used it once in a private letter to Max Born near the end of his life, never in public and certainly never in an actual academic paper about quantum mechanics. People often misrepresent Einstein?õ????s views, suggesting that he thought quantum mechanics
Rather, his point to Born was that he believed quantum mechanics was incomplete as it stood (only being a statistical theory), and that he believed it would one day be completed with an explicitly deterministic explicitly realist theory?õ???? and that he expected that this completed deterministic theory would be free from spooky action at a distance. He wasn?õ????t implying that quantum mechanics itself involved spooky action at a distance, just that the absence of spooky action at a distance should be a requirement for any reasonable completion of quantum mechanics.
Most physicists today do not believe quantum mechanics is incomplete, so they do not see any need to speculate about what a completion of quantum mechanics would look like. Quantum mechanics itself?õ????at least as understood in mainstream interpretations like Copenhagen, Many Worlds, Consistent Histories, or Quantum Bayesianism?õ????does not involve any spooky action at a distance. Just quantum entanglement.

I call it surfing my moods. If I try to force myself to work on something when I feel internal resistance to it, I can flop around and be distractable for hours and get very little done. If I what til the tide rises and I have energy and focus for it, I can knock it out of the park. I am exceedingly lucky that I work in a career where micro managing is unheard of. It would drive a micromanaging boss batshit crazy to see me screw around half the time and still manage to produce more than anyone else in my department. But that is just how my brain works. And please no one knock on my door when I am finally in the Zone.
Which means I am always going to procrastinate to a certain extent. I wish I could work steadily over 8 hours, but I can?õ????t. When I procrastinate, I know that I have to do <whatever> and I build focus and feel more and more pressure over time as a deadline looms. I have to have the built up energy from procrastinating to tackle a big project, then *wham* I can get it done. But, never ever ever, do I think that if I wait long enough someone else will do things for me. Ha!! Not in my lifetime. If I don?õ????t do things, things don?õ????t get done. Period. I am kind of jealous that in your life people are helpful. Me being irresponsible would be a totally crap approach?õ????I would just be sitting around watching my life fall apart, because no one is going to do anything for me.

What would happen to insurance companies if we had Medicare for all?	"They will probably go away in their present form. Much will probably be contracted out. Having experience being both a fed and a federal contractor as well as having oversight of a huge government contract, I can give examples of what generally happens Based on my experience.
From what I know about Medicare, it's pretty well run. I've never worked there or know anyone who does. I believe if it was expanded with in its present form, it would be feasible to take over the functions of insurance companies. It's a matter of federal supervisors hiring contractors for functions under their immediate perview rather than an entire function hired out via a mega government contractor. Nothing is foolproof but there is less chance of massive waste and non-performance. The bigger the contractor the more waste and corruption is my take on things. Although lots of people hate big government, there?õ????s a better chance of exposing the crooks by federal workers even if it's just by ?õ????disgruntled ?õ???? co-workers?õ????-they?õ????re not so easy to get rid of as in private industry.

"If you were traveling faster than the speed of light holding a mirror, could you see your reflection?"	"Ah, so quick the sober scientist to dismiss the ignorant, the absurd, the child Einstein riding his beam of light, or fools today asking his very questions. But this particular foolish question has a surprising answer: yes.
In fact, there is no ""if."" The mirror exists, or did exist 9.17 billion years ago, 5.77 billion light years out. Astronomers rely on it.
Superlight speed may be absurd in local space, but in cosmology it's a requirement if you would understand the early universe. The oldest and most distant object we can see is the original atomic gas of the universe--75% hydrogen by mass, 25% helium, some lithium--at the moment of creation from electron / ion plasma. We see the acoustic, standing wave pattern of this material in the stunning images captured by the cosmic background radiation.
But there is something very odd about the pictures. They were taken when the universe was 380,000 years old. That's 13.8 billion years ago. Why do we see it now? How far away can the subject have been that it takes 13.8 billion years for the light to get here?
We know how far away it was: 42 million light years, a distance that light might be expected to cover in much less than even one billion years.
But these were early days, when the universe was expanding much faster than now. One hint of just how fast: divide the distance (42 million light years) by the time the material had (from the bang: 380,000 years) to get so far out. One hundred ten times the speed of light.
At arrival, the speed was less, sixty times the speed of light. But the result is: light emitted by the material in our direction, locally at the speed of light, could not approach us, because the material itself receded faster (metaphor one) or ""space itself"" stretched (metaphor two) so as to ""make it seem"" so.
We do, however, ultimately, see the light. The sketch, drawn from general relativity and the standard model of cosmology (2015 Planck satellite results), shows how.
The light began 13.8 billion years ago, 42 million light years, rapidly moving away from us. For over four billion years it receded, to some 5.77 billion light years. All the while, the expansion of the universe slowed (per the equations of GR) to ""the speed of light,"" while the Hubble distance (at which intergalactic speed is exactly that of light), grew to overtake that 5.77 billion light years. This ""flips"" the direction of the increasingly slow light (from our point of view) from recession to slow approach.
After nine billion more years, the light reaches us, creeping from zero to the asymptotic 299,792,458 meters per second.
This ?õ????Einstein / Hubble Mirror?õ???ù is the only reason that we ever see an object in space with redshift greater than z = 1.433. Every one of them follows the path sketched here, moving away, then turning around, showing up nine billion years after the turnabout (?õ????reflection?õ???ù).
Note that we cannot see anything in space farther than 5.77 billion light years (though all of the objects that we see are farther than that now). As often noted, the CMB material is over 46 billion light years out, a number reflecting, not ultimate size, but the limit of what relativistic dynamics delivers at age 13.8 billion years.
The size of the universe is completely unknown.

"What does a large naval warship, like an aircraft carrier, do if an anchored civilian craft is in its way?"	"In international waters, a carrier (just like any other ship) is governed by the
In US waters, ships are governed by the US Coast Guard Rules of the Road.
In essence, a ship has the responsibility to avoid a vessel which has a restricted availability to maneuver. In other words, don?õ????t hit the anchored ship.
Routinely, when an aircraft carrier is departing/arriving at a US port (and often at international ports), the Coast Guard (or other applicable authorities) provide escort vessels to assist in clearing the channel, and warning other vessels to remain clear. This is done for safety and security reasons.
An aircraft carrier will generally not run around at ?õ????top speed?õ???ù when in the vicinity of other traffic (such as shipping lanes, and near shorelines). Therefore, the probability of encountering anchored ships is low.
However, that does not mean it can?õ????t happen.
I recall one time when our carrier was transiting between San Francisco and San Diego. Our airwing had disembarked, and we were without escorts. Normally, in this situation, we would transit at fairly high speed. However, that day was foggy, and (except in combat) safety is always the highest priority. Even though small vessels routinely have radar reflectors, we didn?õ????t want to take the chance of running over someone. We therefore posted lookouts on the bow, sounded the foghorn, and crept along at a speed that would allow us to avoid any visual contacts.
Okay ?õ???? here?õ????s an unrelated anecdote.
Take a close look at the photo. That?õ????s a picture of my carrier transiting the Golden Gate Bridge. You will notice there are civilian vessels (sailboat), and also a tug and a Seahawk. You can bet that there are also Coasties out in front of the ship.
The clearance of the bridge above mean water level is 220 feet. It happens that our carrier was just a little taller than that. Therefore, prior to transiting under the bridge, we had to remove a stub mast at the top of the island. We also scheduled all our transits at low tide (no point in taking chances). To my knowledge, no carrier has ever hit the Golden Gate Bridge!

"Which installment is best in SIP, monthly or quarterly?"	"Before writing the proper answer want to convey the biggest advantage of SIPs. Sip bypasses the volatility of market. Cost gets averaged?õ???? out. What i mean is if in a month market is bullish then you will have more growth. If market is bearish you will get more units which in due course of time (market will again be bullish. This is a cycle) will give you even better returns.
Now in between monthly or quarterly sip, the concept is most of us prefer monthly sips since we get salary / fixed income on monthly basis. One thing you can understand that with monthly sips averaging out of market is even better.
But if you are in such a business that your monthly income is not constant with high level of variability and with in a 4 month period your income is somehow constant then there is nothing wrong in opting for quarterly sips.

Is it wrong to not care about other people?	"It?õ????s understandable to not want to get involved into other people?õ????s relationship problems. That is a REALLY difficult area to navigate.
However, when it looks like the abuse is something that can physically put a person in danger, then there is usually an instinct in some people to want to protect that person-whether by calling the cops or other means. It takes courage to put one?õ????s self into a dangerous situation to protect someone else. So it is very understandable if there are some people who would put self preservation over protecting a stranger. It takes a special kind of bravery and selflessness to be able to help someone.
At the same time, I think it takes personal experience to really be able to understand being in such situations.
Is it wrong? Who knows. I think you?õ????re just really honest. The truth is, we never really know how we will act unless the situation is actually present before our eyes. Maybe you might actually feel that instinct to help-and the adrenaline might kick in and you might act before you know it. People who say they will help might actually not. We really don?õ????t know what we would do until it happens-because it is completely different discussing it vs. being there and witnessing it.
At the same time, I can?õ????t help but wonder if you experienced something in your past where you helped someone and it backfired on you? Or do you live in a country where such ?õ????scams?õ???ù that take advantage of other people?õ????s kindness and willingness to help are common? I can?õ????t help but think that people can be socially conditioned to become wary like you. It?õ????s an unfortunate world we live in where helping someone can be misconstrued or cost us. It?õ????s unfortunate for the people who actually do need that help.
Also reading your comment about debt, owing, and power-even if you don?õ????t owe anything in the moment (in which case you don?õ????t care about these people)-you never know when you will need someone else?õ????s help in the future.
But yeah, I think you?õ????re just honest.

What are the best and worst feelings in the world?		
Can SVT/AV/VT cause anxiety?	"Most definitely!
With SVT and nonsustained VT, one's heart generally is racing. One becomes short of breath, lightheaded, sweaty, pale and nauseous, typically.
One might even pass out from decreased cardiac output, since the chambers of the heart don't have time to fill properly. Thus, oxygenated blood is not moving forward to the vital organs. Fatigue is definitely a component.
Sustained VT is a true medical emergency. There is stable VT, generally at a slower rate, where the patient is alert and still has a pulse and decent blood pressure. However, this must be treated quickly since there's no way to know if or when it will become unstable VT, where the patient loses pulse and blood pressure. Unstable VT is treated by shocking the heart under ACLS protocols, as well as medications, to try and restore a perfusing rhythm compatible with life.
With AV nodal, or junctional, rhythms, the heart rate is slower, usually 40-60 bpm. One might feel fine with this rhythm. Some might not tolerate a heart rate in the 40s, however, since everyone is different. With lower heart rates, one still might become short of breath or lightheaded, especially with any type of exertion, since the heart can't beat faster to compensate.
There is an accelerated junctional rhythm, 60-100 bpm, arising from the AV node as well. One might not have any symptoms since the heart is beating at a fairly normal rate. However, cardiac output?õ????the forward flow of blood with each pump of the heart?õ????can be affected, since junctional rhythms are not normal, but rather a backup rhythm when the SA node fails. So, one might have shortness of breath or lightheadedness.
Then there's accelerated junctional rhythm, which is greater than 100 bpm. One could be short of breath, lightheaded, sweaty, pale or nauseous, depending on how fast the rate is, and how much cardiac output is affected.
In all of the above cases, one could experience anxiety from knowing something is not right with his/her heart and from wondering if the underlying cause can be found quickly and treated appropriately. And that is key: the cause of these arrhythmias must be found and corrected to ensure they don't degrade into a lethal rhythm.
I can speak from personal experience. I have frequent PVCs, which sometimes make me lightheaded, short of breath, sweaty and weak; when they're especially bad, I have reduced to no exercise endurance, because my effective heart rate is in the 30s.
One night, I was at work in the ER. My heart suddenly started racing. I literally felt the blood draining from my head and my vision went dark. I knew I would pass out in seconds if I didn't try something. I did a Valsalva maneuver, which?õ????luckily?õ????worked to keep me from fainting.
An EKG just after the incident showed only frequent PVCs, but a Holter later showed nonsustained VT. That night, it must have lasted longer, because it's the only time I was that close to losing consciousness. I am on multiple cardiac medications to try and control the PVCs. However, I then developed sick sinus syndrome and had to have a pacemaker placed. This device has improved my symptoms greatly.
I can tell you that my anxiety level was sky high that one night in the ER, and during other ER visits as a patient when my rhythm was unstable. And I'm not normally an anxious person. It's no fun to know your heart is out of whack and making you feel crummy on top of it!

What is your opinion of Darth Maul?	"Darth Maul, in my opinion, was a largely misunderstood man. He was a victim of fate and of society.
He was abducted from his mother, the witch Mother Talzin, during his infancy by Darth Sidious. Sidious vigorously trained him as an apprentice, seeking to be the one Sith Lord to topple the Jedi from their throne and establish the dark side as the predominant force in the galaxy.
Darth Maul exacted his anger and hatred on the Jedi during the Naboo Crisis, killing Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn during a protracted duel with him and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Kenobi, however, cut him in half and sent his upper half down a trash shaft which took his remains to Lotho Minor.
He lived as a hermit on the junk planet, scavenging legs to substitute for his missing torso. He slowly went insane, harnessing his hatred for Obi-Wan, refusing to die. He was found by his brother, Savage Opress, during the middle of the Clone Wars. Together, they formed the Shadow Collective, a group of crime syndicates and the Mandalorians, which conquered Mandalore and several other planets within the system.
Darth Sidious, now known as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, was dismayed and surprised by Darth Maul?õ????s survival and newfound power. He travelled to Mandalore and dueled the two brothers, killing Savage but keeping Maul alive for torture.
Maul escaped with the help of Gar Saxon, hiding as a refugee until the rise of the Rebellion. Accompanied by the Jedi Kanan Jarrus and his apprentice, Ezra Bridger, he killed two members of the Inquisitorius, until he was forced into hiding once more.
He sought Kenobi - he had not forgot about him. After finally finding him on Tatooine, Maul engaged Obi-Wan in a duel that was cut short. Maul, having attempted to kill Kenobi using the same move he used against Qui-Gon Jinn, was predictable and thus exposed his chest when going in for the killing blow.
In the moments before he died, Maul?õ????s anger and hatred melted away to reveal a vulnerable, saddened man. He sought comfort in Kenobi, the only one who he could talk to on the threshold of death - and died assured that he would be avenged.
Maul was a character who hardened himself over time, seeking only revenge and exacting it upon those who got in his way. He died an unfulfilled man, one who was never truly evil, but one who only sought his own form of justice. And for that I pity him.

So even if you have attempted both the questions with 'OR' choice, there's a high chance that the first question according to your attempted order is taken into consideration! Or there's a very low chance of considering the highest mark out of the two!
Hope this helps!
All the best! :)

What is a fast paced life?	"A fast paced life means a life of action and constant activity! One where you get to run from amazing event to the next amazing event.
First you are at your work, producing massively for the world, in the next you are running to a lunch with your partner and you talk about how amazing the day is, then, after the scheduled hour it is right back to run to work to an important meeting. Afterwards you run back home so you still have the time to enjoy with your family.
That is what a fast paced life means. It is not like most people say

Did Virat Kohli really overreacted in the recent test series?	"That's intrinsically built in at Virat Kohli's nature. He is emotional and this breed of people react and at times over react. Be it a fielding lapse or an allegation or a illicit approach, Kohli reacts and it's his nature.
Some times it might help but mostly it will not as you just tend to think abt all this time and again and it impacts your job as a batsman and captain.
Cricket match and its moments are similar to life, one should not think about the past incidents and should move forward.
Although it's an initial stage but I like Rahane's approach to respond with performance both as a captain and batsman. Sledging is part and parcel of the Aussie approach. Kohli and company should return it back with similar performance in Australia as they did in India.

If you go to a CBSE school, consider yourself lucky, as absolutely no question would be framed on topics that are not a part of the NCERT textbooks of classes 9 and 10.

"Can/Do mutants exist, as shown in X-Men?"	"First, let's start off with the fact that mutations do not mean retractable adamantium claws nor the ability to control the weather. In fact, these little genetic typos typically result in very minor changes, which (when they aren't deadly) are often not visible.
Mutations are the means by which nature adds new variants into the genetic pool. If these traits are advantageous (or at least benign), they are passed along through the generations until they become a normal part of a species' grander gene pool.
Without mutations, evolution would not be possible, a species could never gain new abilities or attributes. For example, in our species' recent past (around 12,000 years ago), a single human had a mutation that gave him the ""superpower""
Scientists believe that every time the human genome duplicates itself there are around 100 new

How do I tell my professor at the university that I feel that the curriculum is too slow for me and would like to get a chance to learn faster (IT field)?	"The US military has a saying: ?õ????Crawl, walk, run.?õ???ù
Maybe you only think that you are ready to move faster, but you haven?õ????t yet mastered the fundamentals of crawling. Fundamentals work is boring. Everyone wants to run fast.
If you believe you are ready for more advanced work, gather your proof for this idea and make an appointment to meet with your professor to discuss this topic. Present your information, express your concerns, then shut up and listen. Truly listen. Your professor is the expert, and knows what it takes to be able to truly run. Perhaps you aren?õ????t quite ready for more advanced work, but they can suggest some additional exercises to help you solidify your current skills. Perhaps you are ready to move on to more advanced work. Your professor will explain the methods available for advancing you in the program.
Another option is to look for programs that are self-paced. you have to be careful with these programs, because you get what you pay for. Self-paced programs are in essence individualized instruction, so even if you are in a ?õ????class?õ???ù, the instructor has to monitor the progress of each individual. This requires a lot more time than a standard class on a standardized instructional schedule. These self-paced classes will either cost a lot more money to account for this extra level of individual attention, or you won?õ????t actually be receiving the level of individual attention promised in the advertising materials.

Set a goal (getting fit, clearing an exam, getting a job, proposing to a person, doing a solo trip etc.), take a paper and write down what you feel is the process to achieve that goal along with a timeline.
Now the only conscious thing you need to do is to remember about this paper and follow it as per the plan. You have to ensure that you stop thinking about the goal as it would make you anxious every time you think of it.
Effectively what you are doing is that you are concerned about improving the process and making sure that the steps towards your goal fulfilled.
This is what is needed to be done to realize your potential again.

What are some things people will do to fuel their addictions?	"According to the ASAM (American Society of Addiction Medication) Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, retention and related circuitry. Addiction is characterized by an inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of substantial problems with one?õ????s behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response.
Thus, with the characterization of being incapable to physically control the internal circuitry of the brain. An individual will pretty much do anything to satisfy this need. Such as robbing a bank or person to provide them with the money to buy drugs. A gambler will take risks without questioning its effect because the chance of winning a bet is more important as this rewards the brain.
A new addiction that is hardly mentioned is that of your phone that's in your hand right now as you read this commentary. The smartphone technology has provided an infinite quantity of brain rewarding applications within the device. The deviation is that which makes it most potent is that it's used as a basic utility as well, such as the telephone, texting, GPS, reading, watching programs. All done for the convenience of advancing technology to human.
I imagine the long term effects of this type of addition is going to be catastrophe in the sense of permanent death that the chemical makeup of drugs can produce rather its damage to the sociological makeup of our societies and cultures. The desire for the human interaction person to person still lingers. But conveniently is no longer legitimate.

How good is Cocos2d-x for building 2D games for the Android platform?	"But I?õ????ll recommend go for
cocos2d-x has ground up 2d support, and since the programming model is quite similar to cocos2d, a great library based solution. Cocos2D-x has no integrated design environment. The design of screens or interfaces should be done with programming, loading images and positioning them with C ++. You can, however, use external graphics editors like
Cocos2D-x
Both technologies are cross-platform, but it is Unity which is the better of the two. Cocos2D-x allows developing for different mobile technologies including iOS and Android. Unity adds the rest: console, desktop and browser.
There is abundant Unity documentation. There are clear video tutorials and texts. Cocos2D-x documentation, however, is scarce and of poor quality. Only available in English and sometimes only in Chinese.
With Unity development time is reduced at much higher rate than the proportion of development time wrt Cocos2Dx. Many of its features you simply cannot get with Cocos2Dx and it allows you to compile more than Cocos2Dx. Thus, Unity3D is better than Cocos2Dx and that?õ????s why I recommend the same.
Being said all of this ?õ???? Unity3D and Cocos-2dX are both capable engines that are used by professional game development teams and have a huge number of shipped titles.
So to answer your question Cocos2Dx isn?õ????t bad choice, It does job pretty good but here you can have some better option to go for your Game Development.

"If there was mass killing, and someone says they're glad it was done, in response to which you punch the other guy in the face, can you be sued?"	"Yes.
You can get sued, and the other person is likely to win, but if all you do is punch them in the face, the damages are likely to be small, and you will probably end up paying their medical bills, and the worst case is that you send a few days in jail.
The reason that you don?õ????t get legal immunity for stuff like this is then you have to ask the question how far the immunity goes. Suppose instead of punching them in the face, you take out a gun and shoot them in the face. What happens then? O.K. Suppose instead of punching then in the face, you slap them or you step on their toe.
O.K. lets suppose instead of a terrorist attack, your friend was in a car accident, or suppose it?õ????s your son that got killed, or your aunt, or your step-brother. Let?õ????s suppose they were drunk at the time. Let?õ????s suppose you were drunk.
The law really doesn?õ????t want to make any of these tricky judgments, so they will just look at the offense.
In practice, people get into fights all of the time, and the legal consequences for punching someone in the face aren?õ????t huge if its your first offense. If you don?õ????t have a prior criminal record, you?õ????ll likely have to pay a fine, and you may have to pay the other person?õ????s medical bills. If there is any jail time, you can likely get probation.
Now if instead of punching someone in the face, you take a baseball bat and keep hitting them until they are seriously wounded, that?õ????s something else. Also if it turns out that you have a habit of punching people in the face, this also matters.
What I suppose matters more than what the law does is what your friends and close relatives think about it.

What is something you have never done?		
Do most citizens of Sub-Saharan African countries feel closer to their countries or to their own ethnic groups/tribes?	"Tribes by a long shot. This is because the tribes and by extension clans, have existed long before the creation of the modern states and to a certain extent, most modern nations are only cutouts of what were established by the colonial powers.
To a certain extent, there are no real Kenyans, Nigerians, South Africans or Angolans. On the most basic ground level, a person will grow up knowing they are Kikuyu, JaLuo, Hausa, Fulani, Xhosa, Zulu, or Akan. The idea of being identified as a Kenyan, Ugandan, Ghanaian or other nationality only begins to come up in school, for international sports or other issues which are pushed for outside issues.
Though some nations have sought to do a good job of promoting a sense of nationalism, particularly Tanzania, it?õ????s usually done as a means to garner some kind of political vote or gain currency for some issue.
One of the main aspects, as to why America and even European nations have done well is because an individual can come from any part of the country and still rise to the highest seat in politics or still become wealthy. As an example, Obama is originally from Hawaii, Bush from Texas, Clinton was from Arkansas, Reagan was from California, Ford was from Nebraska and Carter is from Georgia. In the UK, Theresa May is from Sussex, Cameron is from London, Gordon Brown is from Scotland, Blair is from Scotland, John Major is from Surrey and Thatcher was from Lincolnshire. And on top of this, there are highly influential political and business figures from all parts of England. With the exception of Northern Ireland, no region of the UK can legitimately say they?õ????ve been historically marginalized politically or economically. This isn?õ????t to say that the US and the UK have established perfect systems, far from it. However, the opportunity to live, get a decent education, get a decent job and live a respectable life is far greater in nations which provide more opportunities for people, regardless of their regional or tribal background.
Thus, an individual from Hull or Liverpool will be proud to say they are British and see this as a means of their primary identity, whereas someone from Kivu (in the DRC), Tamale (Ghana) or from Rivers State in Nigeria. This is because they know from experience that their nationality doesn?õ????t mean anything when it comes down to how resources are allocated, decisions are made, schools and roads are built and who is allowed to move up the economic and political ladder.
Some nations are definitely trying and the first one that truly develops a state which provides equal opportunity to everyone in its nation will develop at a rapid pace and be a true shining light for the rest of the nation.

It is important to understand that Islamic Banking is based on a strong value system. It lays great emphasis on
It ensures that financial capital does not lead to artificially bloated asset prices. Instead, it is made to work in the real economy, on real projects.

You are purchasing a house worth 100,000.
You make a down payment of 20,000 and take a loan of 80,000 to be repaid over 4 equal annual installments.
Thus, currently own
Your repayment schedule would look something like this:
So essentially - over the years you are buying a larger portion of ownership of the house.
Suppose the rent is 2,000 p.a., you will pay as follows:
Year 1 - 2,000 x 80% (bank?õ????s ownership% during the year) = 1,600
Year 2 - 2,000 x 60% = 1,200
Year 3 - 2,000 x 40% = 800
Year 4 - 2,000 x 20% = 400
Year 5 - The asset belongs to you 100% - no need to pay rent.
The co-ownership factor has several other benefits as well.

How has keeping a diary helped you in your life?	"Yes. I started keeping a diary - I call it my journal - 40 years ago when I was traveling between high school and college, first down the East Coast of the US, then to England and France. I wanted to be a writer, and everyone told me that the more I wrote and the more of my experience I captured in writing, the better a writer I would become. Also, by writing down dreams and ideas, I would always have stories to write.
That is all true.
At the same time, I always found it easy to keep my journal every day when traveling, but very hard to keep it up when living at home - even in my own home. I don?õ????t know why.
Some time after 2000, I read a book called

None of that would have happened if I didn?õ????t have the core practice of writing in my journal just about every day.

I do not ever want to walk on eggshells ever again in front of a partner when I feel like cutting loose. When I found the man that became my husband, I was thrilled because he is a goofball. He takes the right things seriously, without having a stick up his ass, and for everything else he is simply a goodball.
He makes it his main purpose each day to make me smile, whether that means dancing around or doing voice impersonations.
His past partners were not of the same notion that I am, and had more of the outlook that your girlfriend has ?õ???? they were angry at him a lot for not taking everything seriously. He felt confined and not understood. He thought he was doing something wrong.
Everyone has different ideals of what they would like to see in a mate ?õ???? none of the ideals are incorrect, but sometimes people end up starting a relationship that doesn't meet the basic ideals that person really truly wants. Sometimes they can suck this up, and sometimes they can only suck it up until they burst and gripe at their SO for something it seemed they've previously been ok with. It becomes confusing for the SO, and questions like yours result.
Some people then try to mold themselves to their partner?õ????s ideals, but I am telling you from experience that this is the absolutely wrong path to take. You deserve to be yourself, and she deserves to find someone who meets her ideal.
Sit down and talk with each other, as neither of you should be settling here. You do not have to settle ?õ???? there are plenty of ladies out there who would appreciate having a laid-back guy, and there are plenty of men out there who enjoy being the serious business guy, and will appreciate having someone who likes that.

What were some circumstances of friendly fire during WWII?	"My father was a pilot in the RAF during the war, until he was shot down by a Luftwaffe Messerschmitt that is.

It didn?õ????t matter what type of aircraft you were flying or what sort of markings were on the wings and fuselage, if you were in range of them they opened fire.

Why is dating someone defined as just a game defined by certain rules?	"You are correct that it's just a game.
Any game has a pre decided rules,similarly dating.
What picture is coming in mind when dating word is heard.
Boy and girl meeting at a particular place with tea , coffee or meal. In the whole scenario they are looking for the chance that there is any possibility of being physical or not . Or next one is having potential to gift her or not. There is nothing to do with feeling and emotion. That's why it's not having much significance over here.
Dating means making a date memorable which is possible with good memories, and feeling. This is possible if thought of each others are shared and both get mutually benefitted. At the end of the date also one may feel the same freshness with the memory of also. With the wish also one can't forget such date.

What about the build quality of Bajaj Pulsar rs200 and engine refinement and durability as compared to Yamaha fz25.?	"RS200 build quality:
Being a faired bike, this aspect will significantly be different. Overall, the only thing that Bajaj has totally missed on is adding rubber padding in the joints between the plastic panels of the fairing. This gives rise to some amount of noise at higher speeds.
Apart from the bike is pretty well built. No other vibrations or noise from the bike.
Refinement: This is one aspect that greatly differs between the Duke 200 and the RS200. The RS200 engine makes slightly lesser power, but is smoother than the Duke 200. So it?õ????s pretty refined as is.
Beyond this, considering the additional stuff you get on the RS200 than the FZ25:

How can I discover the entire set of Marvel and DC comics characters and their relationships? Any books or websites I should read or visit?	"You can look through the encyclopedias for each one, or use the wiki sites. Wiki splits into several offshoots, including the different worlds/timelines that have been featured in the comics, and also the movies, because each one has a different take on the characters and their relationships. Also, you can look for information on a forum, but that might give you many conflicting statements because those answers are given by fans and each might answer for a different world/universe in DC and Marvel.

Why do I get so much sweat on my foot?	"Sweat is produced by sweat glands which are distributed all over the body. Sweat glands are present in large number in feet as compared to the other body parts. Sweating is a mechanism which regulates the body heat, helps in getting rid of excess water and salts and protects the skin from infection and keeps it healthy. The amount of sweat produced depends upon the the activity of sweat glands which is regulated by the nerves and hormones produced in the body.
On feet the excessive sweating helps in creating more friction which helps in walking by increasing the grip on ground.

Will movies exist in 10 years?	"My DeLorean is in the shop right now so I?õ????m speculating but I?õ????m going to say ?õ????YES?õ????.
Because films are essentially stories and stories have existed in one form or another throughout all of human history.
As to the format?õ???? that?õ????s anyone?õ????s guess. It might be that in the future these images are beamed directly into our head as we sleep and play out like dreams that we remember clearly. Given the pace of life is always speeding up this would save the long hours of going to the cinema, sitting through trailers then a movie.
I do think actors will still be used, because as good as computer created characters might be we as people always know they are not real, we need a tangible actor to really have us psychologically invested in them.

I feel like converting from Islam to atheism. I feel scared that I'm making the wrong choice. What should I do?	"You did not give much information. Ask yourself the good questions:
You say you are converting to atheism. Does it mean that you reject your religion? All religions? All gods and deities?
Atheism means that you do not believe in gods nor deities. If this is what you now think, then atheism is yours; now. Fine.
If you are rejecting religions but are still believing in one or several gods or deities, then you are just a rebel theist, not an atheist.
The question is: what is your case?
Ask yourself: Why are you abandoning Islam? Do you reject it as a religion or do you ceased believing in God? Whatever is the reason, this is yours but the answer is related to the previous one.
Why should you be afraid of being an atheist? Why should not you be an atheist?
If you don?õ????t believe in God any more, then no superior being will punish you after your death. And if you believe that maybe there is and maybe there is not a God, then don?õ????t be afraid: according to all religions, including Islam, God is supposed to have infinite love for humans. Then, if it?õ????s true, God will never reject one of the humans who do not believe in it.
In a word, don?õ????t be scared.
Choose peacefully without fear.

Where do humans go after they die?	"Well nobody really knows. It?õ????s a question that?õ????s been asked again and again and again.
There are NDEs (Near Death Experiences) and according to the medical world the person who experiences an NDE is ?õ????technically?õ???ù dead according to a list of conditions that they have defined. The thing is that now they?õ????re not dead so there?õ????s no way to guarantee that their experiences were in fact reality or even that in the truest sense of the word, they were dead at all.
Scientists have been able to manipulate the brain and re-create a NDE, so they think it?õ????s just a certain reaction that occurs naturally similar to a death rattle or other ?õ????end of life?õ???ù phenomenon.
I used to read Elisabeth Kubler-Ross and her experiences with death and dying. It was fascinating. At one point she said she experienced every death she had ever assisted with. Maybe it was all her own deaths as we are one.
The problem comes down, I think, in defining reality, and there are a LOT of discussions on what reality is and isn?õ????t. Some believe that we are spirit and physical is only a dream. Others believe that this is all there is and death is the finite end of everything. Some believe we are energy and as such, can ?õ????morph?õ???ù into any form we desire; animals, trees, aliens, whatever. And the list goes on?õ????
There is also a belief that thoughts create reality. This to me is interesting because it indicates that we create the world we live in. We people it with friends, family, enemies and random strangers. If this is the case, do we create heaven or hell or the void because it is what we ?õ????believe?õ???ù comes next? Do those that expect ?õ????streets of gold?õ???ù experience that because they have created it with their thoughts?
Isn?õ????t it interesting, though,that we come into this world crying and disoriented and leave (if we?õ????re lucky) by simply closing our eyes. The common statement is something like ?õ????Oh, they look so peaceful?õ???ù. Nobody can accurately answer your question. There is only one way to find out for sure and you won?õ????t be able to tell anybody either.
Worrying about it won?õ????t help as, so far, I have found no other options. (OK one guy from the bible was simply lifted up to heaven?õ????but there were no photos.) Regardless of what happens, you will one day get the answer to your question. Maybe if there is an afterlife we could meet up and discuss this further once we know for sure.

If you can go out, without yakking on and on about your ex, then go out. Keep dates short, free or near free, and active. This will keep expectations low, give you things to talk about (being active) and not have too much time to fill.

Will most of the augmented reality apps be free?	"Most of the apps don't charge the user for the app. Mostly almost all of the apps are free, which uses augmented reality technology. It's the cost only for the contractors hiring people for developing the AR app. Sometimes you may be charged for the targets too.
Mostly the company developing the app, only charges for the content that they are going to display as well as the cost for some other things that should also be taken into consideration.
Most of the times, an app created with purpose of only product marketing doesn't cost their users money, in which markers or targets are mostly free for use as well as the app. This may contain advertisements in newspapers or magazines. This can be some kind of posters placed around the town so that people may find it and get rewards for it.
For a target which incurs cost to the user involves products, such as coffee mugs, superhero or cartoon posters, t-shirts, and various other items that can be sold. You can find such products available in the market. Such as there is a coffee mug which when augmented becomes a basketball rings for you to shoot basketball. It can also include educational products which costs you money through their printed targets, most of which includes children materials, such as Octagon which released several education oriented products in the market.
So mostly the user only have to pay for the targets or the markers, since the for most of the times app along with the target is free.

Are military drones affected by jamming?	"It depends on the drone.
But for semi-autonomous drones, like the Predator, the standard counter-measure is to autonomously fly out of the jammer's range. Jammers have a fairly fast energy dropoff, so their range is really limited.
Also, only enemy military are even likely to have jammers. The devices play havoc on the communication infrastructure of the region it is used in. Shutting down all mobile phones, and radio communication and Wi-Fi while trying to jam a drone is not something that you casually do. Only the military has the authorization to do something that destructive.
But if that is what the military chooses to do, you have to wonder why they didn't use more effective actions, like a surface-to-air missile or an air defense jet. Drones are really vulnerable to any sort of air defense. Which is why they are used on non-military targets like the Taliban.

"If Singapore and Malaysia go to war, which country will emerge victorious?"	"Every male who has done National Service in Singapore knows the answer. We have simulated the scene in trainings.
Our war doctrine mimic those of the Israelis and prefers a preemptive strike rather than a reactive defence.
Our training ground simulates all kinds of terrain you commonly found in our neighbour. Our terrain is urban built up area which only favours entrenched and hidden forces.
If a war really breaks out, our people will fight knowing that failure will result in complete annihilation of whatever we have built in the past. So everyone has already been prepared to do the ultimate sacrifice required of him, down to even the elderly and women. The stake is higher for us than them.
While it depends on what is the cause for the war, our neighbour's citizen may not be prepared to fight for the cause 100%.
As for who will emerge victorious, once a war broke out between the two countries, no matter who wins, the devastation will make the price too high to even consider starting one.
That is what Singapore has always tried to do,

Are you a non-Republican Christian?	"Yes. In fact, I am a fairly ?õ????fundamentalist?õ???ù progressive Christian. The biggest difference between me and Republican/conservative Christians is that I am not a single issue voter?õ????abortion?õ????even though I am pro-life. I used to vote pretty much the Republican party line, until I realized a few things. First, Republicans didn?õ????t have a problem with Roe-v Wade for at least 7 years after the ruling. In fact, when Francis Schaeffer and his son Frankie first approached Jerry Falwell about it, Falwell said, ?õ????Abortion isn?õ????t an evangelical thing; it belongs to the Catholics.?õ???ù In fact, the Southern Baptist Convention was all in favor of Roe. Don?õ????t kid yourself: Millions of ?õ????Christians who were ?õ????pro-life?õ???ù then would be all in favor of abortion rights if their daughter got pregnant by a black kid. No, it was all about votes and getting Jimmy Carter out of the White House in 1980. Jack Kemp told Francis Schaeffer, ?õ????You get us the (evangelical) votes, we?õ????ll get Roe repealed. Well, Schaeffer helped get out the vote, but Roe is still law of the land.
Second, even when Republicans
Third, I saw that the anti-abortion issue was really doing more damage in the long run to the cause of Christ then pro-choice. Why? Because Christians were duped into becoming single issue voters. Abortion = murder, who wants murderers, baby killers in power? I can sympathize with that, and could actually follow it IF the people contending against the ?õ????baby killers?õ???ù were not such horrible people in other areas. What this single issue did was allowed some really deplorable people to run and get elected. Think Newt Gingrich. A truly morally depraved person, an adulterer who served his wife?õ????s divorce papers while she was in the hospital for cancer treatment, not only is extolled for his patriotism and conservative values, he is elected Speaker of the House by his party. Apart from his pro-life stance, he was morally challenged in just about every other way. Christians could have a veritable Billy Graham run against Pol Pot, and if Graham were pro-choice and Pol Pot were pro-life, they?õ????d vote for Pol Pot!
I am still pro-life; but at this point, with Roe not going anywhere, I have to ask myself, ?õ????Which party?õ????s policies are going to l

What is the best structure for URL for better SEO?	"An optimized URL is a Search Engine and a User friendly URL.

For example, this URL:

Here are a few points which you need to keep in mind:
These are nothing but the variables added to the URLs.
The above characters marked in red are the parameters. Instead of adding these complicated characters, it is advisable to add real and clear descriptive words that are easy to understand by the users.
Its better to use something like this:

This should always be avoided. Capital letters in URLs encrypt the URL, making it incredibly difficult to remember.
Also,
Keywords should be present in the URL but not more than what is necessary. The important keywords should be kept at the beginning of the URL as the Search Engines pay greater attention towards that part.
Example:
You might not want some pages to be indexed by the search engines (some sensitive information or any page which is not-so-connected with your website). Its better to block such URLs with robots.txt.
These URLs containing characters like ?õ????&?õ???ù ?õ??????õ???ù ?õ???ù_?õ???ù are difficult to read and understand by the user. A lot of these unwanted parameters make the URLs Non-Seo-friendly too.

For example: If the category is of Apple laptops containing 50 plus items, these can?õ????t be displayed on a single page. It might require 2 or 3 pages.

How can I help my 3 year old understand language?	"If you are worried about your child?õ????s development, talk to her pediatrician and her teachers. Have her evaluated. Where there are problems, early intervention makes an enormous difference.
If you are just curious in general how to support language development, the answer is spend time talking to your child.
From the time you have an infant you are supporting language development by narrating your world. As you go through your day with your child at your side, you explain what you are doing: It?õ????s time for us to start making lunch. First we are going to wash the carrots. We?õ????re going to scrub them gently with this brush to get off any dirt or chemicals on them. Can you help? Now we are going to cut off the end of the carrot. That part is too hard to eat. Etc.
By narrating your day, you are providing language in context for your child. She is going to absorb concepts as you go along. As you wait for the water to get warm, you will show her how you test it and at first it is too cold, then still not warm enough, and then perhaps too hot! In this way you are teaching the concept of comparisons and that some things?õ????like temperature?õ????are relative. As you engage your child in what your are doing, she will learn concepts like hard/easy, heavy/light, too much/too little, etc.
In addition to describing concrete concepts like soft, rough, bumpy, you can introduce abstract concepts like emotions. Use a wide variety of words. Label your child?õ????s expressions and help her see and feel the difference between annoyed, grumpy, frustrated, angry, ready to explode. Use concrete examples she can see, hear, and feel to understand abstract notions.
My son had a language processing disorder. It meant that he didn?õ????t absorb language the way some children do. He needed lots of hands on demonstrations of even straight forward concepts like under/over, in front of/behind. on/above. Whereas other kids would easily pick up the difference between crossing the street and across the street, he would need to hear the two examples next to each other?õ????maybe even to draw or act out the differences.
The short answer is you can help your child?õ????s language development by spending lots of time interacting with her both in the real world and through the world of books. When reading to her, take the time to answer questions about things and to rephrase words and ideas as needed. Stop and connect what you are reading to your child. You might say, ?õ????This character is so angry because everyone is telling him to go play and not bother them. Do you ever feel that way? You do? When?õ????s a time you felt that way??õ???ù In this way you invite your child to express herself and to see conversation as an important way of being heard and getting her needs met.
Researchers have not found that human interaction can be replaced effectively with electronic interactions in young kids. Learning is optimal when kids feel secure and connected?õ????when you are involved with them. Although there are products on the market that go slowly and repeat simple concepts over and over, these should not be used as a substitute for personal time spent with your kids. Older siblings, on the other hand, can be wonderful examples, as very often they narrate their activities out loud. As they play and talk to themselves, they model ideas like, ?õ????Brrrrrrrmmm, brrrrrrmmmm, this car is going very fast to the top of this tall mountain.?õ???ù
You are your child?õ????s first teacher, but you don?õ????t have to do anything very sophisticated to develop her language. Just involve her in what you are doing and talk to her.

And believe me, people will say ?õ????Oh, but those are teenagers. I'd get a baby or an infant.?õ???ù And here's the deal. We've been going to adoptive support group for about 8 months now. There's about 20 core members. Some of these adopted their kids at 15 months old, and they are now 20 years old. Others adopted 3 and 5 year olds internationally, and now they are in their teens. Almost all of them have dealt with, or are dealing with, the same trauma-based and adoption-related behaviors that we are. Many are so much worse than what we have. PTSD, Reactive Attachement Disorder, Opposition Defiance Disorder, and about a half dozen other disorders pulled from the DSM-5. I can drone on about brain development, severed emotional bonds and neural pathways in the early stages of human life, but sufice it to say that IT DOES NOT matter what age you adopt the child. The risk for erratic, trauma-driven negative behavior is always there.
So, I am an advocate for adoption as an institution and mechanism to find children forever homes. However, I believe that it isn't for everybody. I believe that prospective adoptive parents should do a LOT of soul searching, conduct research, read books, go to support groups, and talk with therapists

What was it like to travel on a flight that allowed smoking?	"See the controls in this airplane seat armrest? Do you know what used to be embedded there before there was any kind of in-flight entertainment?
Behold the airline seat ashtray. Used to be absolutely standard, whether you were in the smoking section or not.
The smoking section, incidentally, was simply marked by a plaque on a seat back indicating that it started at such-and-such a row. There was no effort to divide the smokers physically from anybody else. In first class, if there were four rows, the back row would be the smoking section.
It was unspeakably vile. The moment they started the engines and began using the internal air system, the smell of stale cigarette smoke came all throughout the plane, because there were weeks or months of it in the air filters. And the filters were wholly inadequate to the task.
Air travel has gone way downhill in many respects since I was young, but in this one it has improved immeasurably.

Do domestic flights and international flights land on the same area at JFK?	"JFK has six separate terminal buildings (terminals: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8).

Flights from upstate New York on JetBlue arrive at terminal 5. Many international airlines that don?õ????t have their own terminal (including Copa and Delta) use terminal 4.

Why spend huge sums on ERP/CRM platforms when today it is possible to build your own applications designed for your specific needs for a reasonable cost?	"Why buy anything if you think you can build it yourself?
Would you build your own car or build your own house? I accept that you might consider building your own house if you had the time to spare, the experts available to help you and the money to do it, but you had better be sure that your wife has the patience to wait for you to finish!
On a serious note, companies like NetSuite, Microsoft, Salesforce and others have spent 18+ years building, updating, testing and optimising the ERP and CRM systems they have created.

Your gift was very sweet, but the more you start putting all this effort toward people who aren?õ????t going to reciprocate it, the more you?õ????re going to be frustrated, and the more likely you are to start adopting the mentality that women are all ungrateful assholes. Don?õ????t go down that path. Your grand gestures of love should only occur in the context of a relationship as a response to your emotional desire to do them. They should not be an attempt to manipulate a woman into liking you or going out with you.

"If the 4 Vedas are all original with absolutely no content lost, why did Swami Vivekananda say many portions are lost?"	"The Vedas are the divine knowledge acquired by the rishis after severe penance which was then passed down from generation to generation through formal institutions comprising of gurus and acharyas.
However, these texts were confined to a very small groups and due to lack of printing technology, the major portions were lost during the various foreign invasions . When foreigners invaded India, many houses and libraries were burned and priests were killed, with this almost three-fourth of the texts were damaged and lost.
In Swami Vivekananda?õ????s word:
Almost the largest portion of the Vedas has been lost. The priests who carried it down to posterity were divided into so many families; and, accordingly, the Vedas were divided into so many parts. Each part was allotted to a family. The rituals, the ceremonies, the customs, the worship of that family were to be obtained from that [respective] portion of the Vedas. They preserved it and performed all the ceremonies according to that. In course of time, [some of] these families became extinct; and with them, their portion of the Vedas was lost, if these old accounts be true.
Some of you know that the Vedas are divided into four parts. One is called the Rig-Veda, another Yajur-Veda, another S?ü?õma-Veda, and the fourth Atharva-Veda. Each one of these, again, was divided into many branches. For instance, the Sama-Veda had one thousand branches, of which only about five or six remain; the rest are all lost. So with the others. The Rig-Veda had 108, of which only one remains; and the rest are all lost.
Then [there were] these various invasions. India has been the one country to which every nation that has become strong wants to go and conquer ?õ???? it being reputed to be very rich. The wealth of the people had become a fable, even in the most ancient history. Many foreign invaders rushed to become wealthy in India and conquered the country. Every one of these invasions destroyed one or more of these families, burned many libraries and houses. And when that was so, much literature was lost. It is only within the last few years that ideas have begun to spring up about the retention of these various religions and books. Before that, mankind had to suffer all this pillaging and breaking down. Most stupendous creations of art were lost forever. Wonderful buildings ?õ???? where, from a few bits of remnants now in India, it can be imagined how wonderful they were ?õ???? are completely gone. . . .

"What if you have sex, do not like it and never want to have it again?"	"I once had a burrito at Boca Grande. I hated it and swore I would never have another. Years passed.

I eat them all the time now.
How many times have you tried sex? Have you hated it every time? If you have limited experience maybe you?õ????ve just had the wrong partner or the wrong attitude.

What killed Kurt Cobain?	"There is very little evidence that Kurt commited suicide. Yes, he was widely believed to have bipolar disorder, but that did not mean he was suicidal. Kurt and Courtney were about to get a divorce. Kurt wanted to cut her out of the entire will, which is currently worth around $450 million, if you factor in her giant chunk of Nirvana royalties, merchandise, memorabilia etc. It is projected to be worth around 1 billion someday.
Courtney hired a private investigater days before his death, and constantly told him Kurt was suicidal, she was worried, and he wanted to divorce her, and he may be seeing someone else. The private investigator, Tom Grant, instantly became suspicious and started recorded almost evert conversation between him and her and Kurts friend, Dylan Carleson.
Two days after Kurts death Tom and Dylan go to his house and look for him. Dylan was Kurts best friend at the time and extended periods of time at the house. The body was in the greenroom, over the garage which is seperated from the main house. Dylan did not even tell Tom the green room existed when they looked, which is also recorded
The shotgun that was purchased was under Dylans name, who bought it with Kurt, a couple days after a home invasion in his house. He bought 2 shotgun shells, for a single barrel. Which doesnt make sense if he is only gonna use it to kill himself. It?õ????s pretty hard to miss. The shotgun also had no fingerprints on it in the end.
The most compelling evidence is the fact that the amount of heroin injected in his bloodstream was 75 times the lethal dose for a non user, and 3 times the lethal dose for a hardcore junkie, which he was not. He was highly productive. the amount of heroin injected into the bloodstream would immediately knock somebody out. The needle was taken out of his arm, put back in his box, and closed. Then he would have had to pick up the shotgun, and be able to pull the trigger.
The shotgun shell also landed on the opposite side of where it would have left the gun, which would have been impossible.
Also, the godmother of Frances Bean Cobain, got immdiately suspicious, as did Courtney?õ????s own father. The chief of police at the time said they screwed up and declared suicide way too fast, the head of the toxicology academy of the united states believes it was murder, as do many other credible forensic specialists, detectives, first responders who were the first to see the body etc. Watch the documentary Soaked in Bleach on netflix, and go to

Where can I get real active Instagram followers?	"The best way to do this is to buy them. If you want to buy them, I only use one provider for this:
I have tried lots of providers and none of them come close to the quality that they offer.
If you don?õ????t want to buy them, here are some tips to gain a following naturally:
1.
For every hundred photos you like on Instagram, you gain 6.1 followers.
Simple as that: Liking content by users that you don?õ????t follow increases your following and also generates likes for your own content as well.
Be careful not to come anywhere close to Instagram?õ????s API limit since once you start approaching that range (350 activities per hour), it raises flags and you might come across an account suspension. Spread out your activity and make it natural. I briefly tested the API limit a while back and found that much like other networks, you can get away with a lot more once you have a bigger following. If you don?õ????t have a lot of Instagram followers, I suggest liking at most 500 photos in a day to play it safe.
Right now, I?õ????m fairly certain that Instagress is the best option as far as Instagram bots go ?õ???? it?õ????s cheap, very user-friendly, has a lot of filters for more advanced marketers to play around with and spreads out activity the most human-like. For years, I had wanted to build out my own product to do this, stumbled upon Instagress and found it had most of the functionality I had envisioned.
2.
This is easily the most important part in creating loyalty in new Instagram followers. Even if someone loves what your brand stands for and engages with all your new posts, it might not stand the test of time. For each new follower I gain that (almost) perfectly fits my target demographic, I hit up their profile, like a few photos then send a DM asking a question about a recent post rather than leaving a comment.
I couldn?õ????t find any stats on how many DM?õ????s are sent out in comparison to likes and comments but it?õ????s safe to assume that it?õ????s comparable to comments or even much lower. Again, we?õ????re using its scarcity to our advantage. Creating a real relationship with a follower makes them much more likely to leave comments on your photos and much more unlikely to unfollow you.
3.
After first connecting your Facebook and Instagram accounts together, your Facebook friends will get a notification letting them know you?õ????re on Instagram. Neil Patel cites in his science of Instagram article that once this happens, 3% of your Facebook friends will immediately follow you and this can be upped to 5% if you make a Facebook status asking for follows.
20% of all Instagram users are also on Facebook.
4.
The most likely scenario when someone views your profile is they?õ????ll take a quick glance at your last 9 posts and then decide to keep looking or leave. You?õ????ve likely been in this exact scenario checking out someone after they follow you. Your most recent photos should be a testament to what you represent since it?õ????s the main selling point of your Instagram account.
There isn?õ????t really anything scientific I can say about this aspect since it?õ????s quite subjective. Your posts should look and feel the same; consistent aesthetics are what we?õ????re after here. What I can say is that it really helps to plan out your posts 9 at a time so you have an idea of how they?õ????ll look when placed together on your profile. As an example, take a look at my profile ?õ???? my photos are somewhat minimal: neutral colours with hints of blue that mesh well together. I PhotoShop my photos a bit (I?õ????m not that good at photo editing), get them into a square resolution then transfer to my phone for later posting.
5.
Iconosquare is easily your best bet for getting the job done but it?õ????s still going to take some manual work. Many marketers will simply use the most popular hashtags when applicable, but this will earn you a decent amount of bots in your Instagram following and you don?õ????t want that. The whole point of this guide is to help you build a worthwhile following of people you can connect to on a personal level.
Before you put time into searching keywords related to your brand, keep in mind that we are trying to build 2 separate lists of hashtags:
1. Hashtags to Put On Your Posts
2. Hashtags to Automatically Like
Take a look at what types of content you?õ????re putting out on Instagram and split them up into general categories. You should be building lists of hashtags for each category to put on your posts. For example, if you were marketing a record store, you?õ????d want to have a list for general music-related hashtags, locally used hashtags (city, province/state, etc) and another list for vinyl records specifically.
Popular hashtags within your niche aren?õ????t always obvious, so simply searching keywords and calling it a day won?õ????t suffice. Go as general as you can at first, aiming for the most popular hashtag and then scroll down the list of posts to see what other hashtags are used on that type of content. In this example, I searched for #VinylRecords and uncovered niche gems like #DustyFingers and #Cratediggers. As creative as I can be, I wouldn?õ????t have thought of these on my own. Again, make sure to note the volume of each individual tag used.
Entice users to follow your brand on Instagram by hosting an activity that encourages engagement, such as a photo contest. Lancome?õ????s #bareselfie campaign is a great example. They created a specific hashtag and image criteria for the contest: post a picture of yourself wearing no makeup. The contest was a hit with a

It?õ????s also important to remember that social media is not a soapbox. You should make sure that you interact with your audience by liking and commenting on other people?õ????s videos and pictures.

And remember, human connection should always be at the core of any
You want people to know that you?õ????re now on Instagram, so get the word out!

Remember though, it?õ????s not just about telling people that you?õ????re now on Instagram, it?õ????s about giving them a reason to want to follow you on Instagram (more on that with tip 2).
When creating your account, you should clearly define your purpose to your followers. You should define who you are and what you do. What sets your brand apart? Think through who you?õ????re targeting with you social media strategy on Instagram when creating your brand page. It?õ????s ok to be playful and creative in your description, especially if it makes sense to your audience. GoPro?õ????s Instagram shows off a creative, yet informative bio. ?õ????We make the World?õ????s Most Versatile Camera. Wear it. Mount it. Love it.?õ???ù In addition to your bio, you can also include one link. This is an important piece of real estate, so think through where you want your audience to go.
Collaborating with other Instagram influencers in your industry can be a very powerful way to promote your brand. For example, Cathay Airlines teamed up with travel blogger Jessica Stein for a campaign called
When you reach out to an Instagram influencer, you?õ????ll want to consider what you can offer them. Some ideas include offline exposure, a product sample or free merchandise. Whatever it is, you?õ????ll need to address their question of ?õ????What?õ????s in it for me??õ???ù before you ask them to do anything for you. As for finding influencers, you?õ????ll need to search for popular users on Instagram. Rolling Stone?õ????s got a great list of
Not all pictures or videos will garner engagement. Sometimes it has to do with the time of day or even the day of week you?õ????re posting. Other times, it has to do with the actual content of the posts, the hashtags, location tags and description text. You should consistently be testing which posts work best for your audience and what days and times will posts garner the most engagement with your Instagram followers.
According to Kissmetrics,
Test out different days and times to see if that affects your engagement rate. You may find that tagging a different location will get you exposure to a new audience. Whatever you do, don?õ????t be afraid of trying out a post more than once, experimenting against a specific variable?õ????especially if it flops the first time.
To measure and keep track of your engagement rate (the number of likes and comments divided by your followers) on each of your posts try an analytics tool like
The more the number of followers you get for your brand on Instagram, the better is the chance to make people feel how popular your brand is online which will help the conversion rate get upscale impressively. Everything is fair and doable in business.
The process of gaining followers on Instagram is tedious. Sometimes web pages have to be paid to post a link to their site which is expensive and a higher rate at more prolonged duration is not financially a practical idea for small business owners specially. Through buying ?õ????likes?õ???ù, followers can be gained on an instant basis at a relatively low cost. As this is a one-time thing so there is no need to pay consistently for every like and each follower you get on Instagram.
Some sites are there that do not require one to follow several steps to buy followers and likes and actually very easy to do so. Then why will one not take advantage of buying followers and likes, instead of staying engaged to post best pictures on a regular basis and compromise other important tasks in life?
Fashion products and food products get liked by people and also people doing their promotion with visually attractive images of such products by posting on Instagram easily get many followers. However all types of products or services do not interest much the audiences even if they are also necessary to avail.
Traffic to your website can be increased by buying followers. More popularity and ability to make new connections can be achieved.
Unknown to some people, Instagram was bought by
Why would someone want to buy Instagram followers? Because they want to create social proof, that?õ????s why! With Instagram digital marketers have a wide audience of about 100 million active users and it grows every day. It has become far more than a den of selfies and smiling hamsters, it has become a way to increase revenues for your business. As of mid-2014 Starbucks and Nike has published over 14 million Instagram photos combined! Everyone knows those two household brands, but unfortunately not everyone knows what your business is about which is why you can actually create social proof by purchasing Instagram followers and Likes. So what is social proof on Instagram? The idea of social proof stems from humans naturally following each other?õ????s behaviors. If 5,000 people are willing to follow you on Instagram, 5,000 more are sure to follow the crowd.
Almost everyone wants to become popular on Instagram. When you have a large following, you command respect from everyone who views your profile. Being popular on this platform is important if you are an individual or a business. When you are popular as an individual you will look cool and worthy of attention. When your business is popular it will look reputable and high-quality. Developing a big following take a lot of tedious work and time. Luckily, there?õ????s a shortcut ?õ???? our Instagram followers service. When you buy Instagram followers from us, you see the boost instantly. Within days your account will become popular. When people view your new account, they will be surprised. They will think that ?õ????this person has to be special?õ???ù or ?õ????this business has a lot of fans.?õ???ù
Nothing replaces consistent social media use and content creation, but building a social media presence for a new start-up can be an uphill battle. Thankfully, there are some shortcuts that can be implemented. Here are the three main reasons to take some shortcuts and create an Instagram following:
Buying Instagram followers receives instant credibility. The general public has no idea your Instagram followers were purchased, all they will know is that you are obviously legitimate and interesting because so many people are willing to follow what you create.
Peer pressure increases. The average Instagram user will see that thousands of people follow your photos and will feel psychological pressure to join the crowd.
Your image is heightened. If you are an expert, celebrity, or average user, your image immediately receives more attention with the addition of more Instagram followers. Your status is raised to ?õ????influencer?õ???ù with the more social proof you gain through higher numbers of Instagram followers.
A lot of things run through the mind of a consumer when they are deciding to purchase a product or utilize a service. A 2013
Buying from this site has several benefits. First, you get to market your site at a less expensive price. If you have been a long-time Instagram user, you would know by now that the process of gaining followers can be tedious. You need to generate interesting photos to capture the interest of social media users. You have to separate yourself from other profiles by posting fresh material that would gain their attention. You must also release up-to-date posts every now and then to ensure that your previous followers will not unfollow you in the future.
Another advantage is the ease of buying likes and followers from
Finally, GramCart has been proven to offer a legitimate service over time. For the past few years, distinguishing a scam from a real site has become a difficult task for internet users. If you search for a site that offers to boost your followers and likers on Instagram, there is no distinctive way of determining the legitimacy of a site. However, since GramCart has an established reputation in the field of selling Instagram followers, this business has made progress in recent years. Feedbacks from satisfied users are posted in forums; thus, proving the authenticity of the site. Since it was founded several years back, it has established itself as one of the top sites that offer Instagram likes and followers at a very reasonable cost.
Thus, some people resort to advertising in order to increase their popularity in Instagram. Usual methods include promoting their profile on other social networking sites. Some users even pay web pages to post a link to their site. This becomes more expensive because most advertisers require you to pay based on the traffic generated in your profile. This is based on the number of clicks redirected from their page. In addition, they charge a higher rate at a more prolonged duration, which makes this method wearisome and impractical. By buying likes, you can instantly gain followers at a relatively low cost. Since this is a one-time thing, you do not have to repeatedly pay for every liker and follower you gain.

"Who you are at end of the day, is it a gentle person or frusted one?"	"I read one scene on a blog:
A paradise for those who can feel the engrossed serenity in beauty of this spellbinding universe. Virtuosity of universe in managing the aesthetic beauty and keeping everything at its place is nonpareil. She created an eyegasmic enthralling place for herself to fill up the voids of her life. Despite of being in a stifle life with an insecure frail personality she was creative with her imagination. In isolation, away from the daunting society, away from lecherous drooling eyes, she was lost in her own world. Free like swirling air, dancing freely, breaking all the taboos, she created a free sky with a splatter of light on her dark surroundings and threw away the light to make a splash somewhere. Drawing with her hand in the air, filling up with thousands of astounding colors, serene robust hills with a free flowing river of light from it and creating a scene with one of breathtaking beauty. Her eyes sparkled with merriment, a gleam of light kissing the pretty soul, and both hands wide open ready to hug nature. Living in her imagination, confident as Hills, free as river, bubbly as twinkling stars,as 'A Real Girl.'
Depending on our surroundings we behave accordingly. At different situations we have to behave differently which might provoke some swings in the mood but once I am done with that routine and going back to my normal life, I am the real me and try to treat everything in a proper and gentle manner keeping those tensions, frustrations or anything else aside and at the EOD I choose to be the ?õ????Real Me?õ???? .

What are your top favourite wrestling takedowns and why?	"Ankle pick. Cael Sanderson was an ankle-picking machine and never lost a match during college and went on to win an Olympic Gold Medal.
The reason I like the ankle pick is that it forces you to take a low shot and to grab your opponents weakest point on the leg.
In high school I struggled to shoot low. I always shot high doubles and singles. It wasn't until after high school that I realized that all of the best wrestlers shot low.
By shooting an ankle pick, you set yourself up for a low shot. If your ankle pick isn't great, you can switch to a low single or double, but with the opponent's ankle instead of their calf or thigh. The opponent cannot sprawl!
Disclaimer: you have to be quick and have good setups to grab your opponent's ankle.

Why is Trump (a conservative capitalist) compared to Hitler (a liberal socialist)?	"Because political language is so corrupted its almost impossible to use intelligibly, and its use in the question shows the influence of those intent on corrupting it further. None of the adjectives applied to Trump or Hitler, except possibly for ?õ????capitalist?õ???ù has been used correctly.
Properly, a conservative is someone who seeks to conserve certain institutions or the ways of life that they support. In the specifically American context, a conservative is just a member of one of two political tribes, which is more conservative but not really especially so.
Similarly a liberal is someone who advocates political freedom for all citizens. In the specifically American context it refers to the other political tribe, which is somewhat more liberal, although with notable areas of weakness.
A socialist is someone who believes that all productive resources should be owned by the workers who use them. Socialism has almost no influence in American politics. A moment?õ????s thought will show that you can be a liberal socialist or a liberal conservative or even a conservative socialist if we try to use the words correctly and not merely as tribal markers.
With the actual meaning of words in mind, lends try to apply them to Hitler and Trump. It should be obvious that Hitler wasn?õ????t either liberal or socialist - he didn?õ????t advocate for worker?õ????s ownership, nor did he support political freedom. Quite the reverse in fact - he supported a small group of crony capitalists in controlling most German industry and imprisoned and tortured his political opponents. The Nazis used the name ?õ????socialist?õ???ù in the name of their party as a way to garner working class support, which was important early on, but they were not socialist in anything meaningful sense. On the contrary were some conservative aspects to Nazism - its focus on German identity, ?õ????normal?õ???ù families, and traditional beliefs about work and valor. There?õ????s a line of thought on the American right that tried to create analogies between the Nazis and liberal trends in early 20th century America, but this doesn?õ????t appear to be anything more than an erudite form of slander.
Trump, similarly, is appealing to conservative ideas about nation and family and tradition, although like Hitler one suspects they don?õ????t resonate with him personally. He?õ????s also not socialist in any noticable way. By nature of the polity he?õ????s working in, currently at least he?õ????s more liberal but he?õ????s showing disturbing authoritarian tendencies, and this is why people are drawing analogies.
Because while you can be a liberal and a conservative, or a liberal and a socialist, depending on the exact circumstances, the thing you certainly cannot be is liberal and authoritarian. People are drawing analogies between Trump and Hitler to draw attention to the risks posed by Trumps conservative authoritarianism, although obviously any such risks are at a much earlier stage than those posed by Hitler when he came to power.

The Corning Company owns the technology that improves the glass composition so that it is able to resist deep scratches which breaks glass. They call this ?õ????Native Damage Resistance' or NDR.

"If the 2nd Amendment is an absolute right, then would NRA members allow concealed or open carry on a plane?"	"(I'll gloss over the whole ?õ????absolute right?õ???ù nonsense. That's a strawman, OP, and you know it.)
Would
Yup, I sure did.
I think it should be legal for anyone with valid carry permit to be able to carry their gun on a commercial plane (domestic flights only, obviously) so long as they declare it to security and to the crew. The fact of the matter is, anyone who jumps through the hoops to get a carry permit of any kind is pretty unlikely to ever commit any sort of crime, with or without a firearm. In fact in some states concealed carry permit holders are statistically less likely to commit a crime than
So banning people with permits from carrying on a plane isn't really accomplishing anything. It's yet another pointless law that just makes gun-phobic people feel better.
Now for those of you still recoiling in horror from my statement that the government should not ban guns on planes, think about this for a moment. Even if they had the choice, exactly how many airlines do you think would allow passengers to carry guns aboard their planes? I'm guessing somewhere close to none.
And even if
And besides, look at the number of answers on this very page from gun owners who think carrying on a plane is a huge safety risk. They're mostly wrong about that, as I've already explained, but they still believe it. Clearly none of them would ever carry a gun on a plane even if they had the option.
Not to mention that unless and until we have 50 state reciprocity, no permit holder is going to want to carry a gun on an airplane. If he lands in a state that doesn't recognize his carry permit he'll be in for a world of legal trouble.
So
So, we've officially established that the law is useless. Even if we struck it down tomorrow basically nothing would change.

How much house can I afford with 750k gross income in NJ?	"You don?õ????t say how much consumer debt they carry, but assuming they have none, they?õ????d qualify for a purchase of around $4.5 million.
I come by this number by calculating a debt-to-income ratio (DTI) of 35%. We calculate DTI by adding up the total house payment including taxes and insurance, plus other debt service, then expressing that number as a percentage of the borrower?õ????s gross monthly income.
Many of the lenders making ?õ????jumbo?õ???ù loans like this one have more stringent underwriting standards. In this case, I am using a DTI of 35% (conventional loans will go as high as 45% and sometimes higher). Lenders making these larger loans will also require cash reserves after the purchase.
A $4.5 million purchase with $1 million down will result in a monthly payment of around $21,750 per month, depending on the property tax rate and cost of homeowner?õ????s insurance.

Is it okay for a 15-year-old to watch Death Note?	"Here?õ????s the summary from
To be honest, watching the show has changed my perspective about the human condition and taught me a new way to approach problems and develop solutions and plans. It shows how a seemingly harmless idea could change your view on our humanity. Light believed that he was helping the world by killing off the ?õ????bad?õ???? people. He just did it in an unusual way but It?õ????s up to the viewer to judge whether what the character did was right/wrong. Both anti-hero Light?õ????s planning and his antagonist L?õ????s solving skills was what kept the tension. they were neck to neck in the process of discovering each other?õ????s secret identities and it was exciting to see which one wold make the next move. The way they approached problems were ingenious and definitely gave me an edge to my analytical skills as I tried to analyze the data alongside the detective.
The supernatural element of the Death notes added the discussion of power to the show. The shinigamis (Grim reapers - the actual owners of the death notes) give us a objective viewpoint on death here, for clearly in the show, it is seen that Men cannot handle the power of controlling one?õ????s lifespan, however moral or clever. If Shinigami get bored of such a power, what about us?
Light?õ????s logic about his actions actually make sense when he explains and it can strike a chord in anyone. Because if you had the power to clear the wold of horrible people through simply writing their name, would you? The show covers many grey areas and a wide range of important philosophical and ethical questions. It could help your child?õ????s development later and give them a broader prespecive of the world around them. It also covers the topic of love, blind trust and decision making, all important topics for any age. It?õ????s a brilliant show, making viewers think a lot, keeping them at the edge of their seats and making them laugh with the sparse bits of comedy and dark humor.
I understand your concern but there is not much violence. A lot of the tension is based on suspense. There are many deaths but that is an integral grey area the anime aims to question. I would suggest you stop the discriminatory view you have on sensitivity. Boys and girls have a range of sensitivity and it may differ according to what they encounter. Your daughter may be a lot less sensitive and I know too many girls who loved the show. Let your daughter watch the show. It?õ????s not harmful but if you are worried, you can read the manga of the same name (the japanese comic it is based on) or read the plot and reviews online. It is very popular among anime fans. If you want, bond with her by watching the show! you may even like it!

Why do looks matter so much in life?	"Let us look at it from an evolution perspective.
Look at the two animal pictures below. Which one would you fear?
Even if you don?õ????t know what these 2 animals are, which one are you more likely to fear?
The first one right? And why is that? The sharp canine teeth in the first picture.
(First picture is a tasmanian devil and second one is a hamster).
Now, you have never seen a tasmanian devil before, but the fact that it has sharp teeth similar to other carnivorous animals makes you take the decision that the animal is probably dangerous.
This is exactly how humans work. Take knowledge parts from a previous situation and derive inferences in the current situation. And this was quite a valuable survival asset. Making this inference of a dangerous animal even before the animal starts chasing you, gave you a head start in escaping from that animal. And keep yourself alive.
Humans take the same inference by looks to fellow human beings too.
I have seen somebody who was shabbily dressed and was not serious about his job. So the next guy I meet, if he is shabbily dressed, I am going to derive the same inference.
There was this sharp looking doctor I met who had wide forehead and a ?õ????knowledgeable?õ???ù face and he was good. The next guy who looks similar, I am going to assume the new guy is sharp too.
And that is how humans work. And this is why looks become quite important.

"What is more realistic, Bjj no gi or gi?"	"Realistic for what, James? ?õ????The street??õ???ù I think BJJ has major applications with both gi and no gi in a realistic fight scenario. Even though you aren?õ????t wearing a gi, you are wearing clothes, and the grips I?õ????m used to with a gi will come in really handy when I tie you up with your sleeves, sleeve-cuffs, hood, etc.
No gi? Or No Kimono as my Brazilian brothers call it, is a fantastic application for the art when those grips may not be able to be used. I trained both and find that gi positioning and training set me up to do very well no gi. The lack of grips was more concerning to my training partners who were used to holding them to slow me down in my position changes - rather than slowing down my ability to change position and attempt submissions.
Realistic? They both are. Real World Application? I believe they both do, as long as you realize throwing a triangle on someone who can bomb you on the back of your neck on cement, or while you try to arm-bar someone you get attacked by their friends is an actual threat.
As I?õ????ve shared in many of my comments - for me, the true beginnings of martial arts is awareness. Without it, everything else is useless. So this awareness becomes the focal point through which all martial practice occurs. Awareness of space, timing, environ, number of attackers, etc. Any application of a martial art is easily defeated by awareness, through it, everything else flows.

They don't necessarily have to charge people as in saying ?õ????pay 5$ to compete in (whatever)?õ???ù. They can if they want to however.
Here's a couple of examples on the website where I play games.
If you plan on getting more experience points to rank up faster, you need membership, which costs a certain value depending on the amount of time you are willing to have it.
If you are willing to play in tournaments (cash prizes), and edit some stuff on your profile (like username, delete loss history, and that stuff), then you need to use credits for such things. Well, these credits happen to be earned by paying.
The numbers aren't the real ones here, but it could be like 5$ for 100 credits for example, and you could use like 10 credits to change your name.

Can we run two Windows (10 and 7) with a mutual Program Files folder?	"I doubt that you can install and maintain two version of windows on the same drive partition. Both Windows 10 & 7 share some of the same file paths and names, but they are different code bases. This will result in unforeseen version and compatibility issues. Windows also digitally signs some core executables / DLLs to ?õ????attempt?õ???ù to prevent modifications. Even if you did manage to get the system to a stable point, you still have to contend with windows updates trashing your custom configuration.
The hardware constrains would most likely rule out using virtualization. I think your best option is to setup a dual boot install. I would create a partition for each windows version and another to store shared documents.
This configuration would allow you to separately install both version of windows and switch back and forth as needed. Also, both versions of windows would see the third shared partition as another drive. This would allow you to easily access & share content between the versions of windows.

What is the most embarrassing yet funniest moment of your life?	"I was a cocky military helicopter pilot years ago... and found my unit stationed in south Texas with standard Army training exercises.?ˇ We were put up in typical barracks and had a lazy afternoon and were goofing around, many of us still in our sweatsuits from our morning PT.?ˇ There were ROTC troops training outside and doing the typical military inspection routine in formation, where they had to stand at attention forever, and they were facing our barracks...
Being the wise prankster, I had noticed we had rafters in our barracks and came up with the clever idea that someone would get in the rafters and I would turn upside down and have them hold my legs - we would then open the door so the ROTC cadets would have to try and keep a straight face with this upside down guy hanging from the rafters, looking right at them.
All went according to plan, the door was opened and the cadets were struggling to keep a straight face... when one of my even more clever friends decided it would be even more funny if my sweatpants were pulled down (well, really pulled up as I was upside down).?ˇ Needless to say, those cadets got an image that they probably never forgot as I struggled to figure out how to pull my pants back up, as it isn't something I've ever done before while hanging upside down....

Is there a correlation between anxiety and depression and the falseness of the world?	"I really respect and admire your question. Its well put.
I would have asked it myself exept for my defensiveness and worry about critism. Stupid people (false by nature or nurture) are passionate defenders of their superior stances! They yell. They hang on to their intensely shallow, small vantage point arguments and hang in like pit bulls.
You are asking the public to take the blame for something most people have zero empathy or respect for. Weakness, sensitivity and depression. Honesty. Stegnth is tenacity and numbers. Love us winning and family teams.
I believe that depression, anxiety and other mental health issues are epidemic because we are living in a false world (true world/ false values). The rate of speed for information and volume and intensity of that is so great our brains and psyches have become punching bags. We can't even hold a thought, let alone process it with any meaning beyond it's presentation.

I was at a car dealership 2 days ago in Boston. In the TV lounge something was happening.
A car attack type thing in Washington D.C. I asked the crowd what was happening. I saw the woman reporter in TV had this bizarre high hair like from the 1950s. I said: OMG! What's with her hair!? Everybody cracked up! Forget the woman who rammed into Whitehouse security with her car. She was killed anyway. It really too funny. That hair. Was the camera man a little too focused in on it? Maybe he too was making the joke. But my timing and insensitivity!
Subliminally I knew we all needed a break from this. But how odd and inappropriate I was. Me, of all people in front of a group of strangers! ( An honest moment actually for all of us) We were all guiltilly laughing at the insane hair of the female reporter. People were dead. Yes it was wrong but: It's becoming commonplace.

I think we're beginning to literalky answer it and take count. Is it one or 10 or 100 or 4,000 before we report it and cut to commercial or the next jaw dropping story or hang on for more details? I think 10 innocent people dead is a worthy but quick news report. Then it's handed iver to social media for the feeding frenzy.
It's easy to see how people are losing their shit and retreating from life. Where do you go when you get scared? Today: inward. Pop psychology are for those who can take the bandaide for all if life's hurts.
I'm always amazed at school shootings. A psychologist was made available for returning students the next day. One day?!?
There's so much to be freaked out and confused and sad about. We're on high overload with manic expectations placed on us for looks, live, success and perfection. Escape is opioids and or pick any addiction. And then have babies while your at it. Well worry about them later.
Success is the Kardashians and the Bachelor and soul crushing jobs.
I think if I keep writing, I'm going to get depressed again. I'm developing a thicker skin literally and figuratively as I am 60 now.

What is the highest salary hike you've had till now?	"I didn't get placement at first place and finally settled with a start up during a huge recession.
Started with 6K/month
First appraisal 12200/month
Second appraisal 17500/month
Only different thing there in my career was, I get the opportunity to work on something very unique at that time. NLP (natural language processing)/ Machine learning/Data science etc.
And nobody knew what the heck it is.
So I earned 17500/month for 3 years in my career, whereas most of my friends were earning like 40K. I was fed up and wanted to go into teaching and also tried moving to java technology that was well known industry technology.
After 3 years, I got first interview opportunity to build a search engine with a well known company and I got 6 LPA pkg.
After that my career growth was good, I learned the value of unique and special skills. I used it as my USP, changed 3 companies after that. Got offers from foreign companies as well. Started earning from freelance work as well.
During the course of last 4-5 years, I have received around 25-30 job offers. I can easily switch a job whenever I want and can ask for even 40 LPA. But now money is not that important factor to me.
I do like learning, still studying from distance-universities, or on-line courses. I do spend a lot of time in on-line competitions. and writing research papers. Overall I keep myself motivated and pose challenges for myself, as I have never got any mentor and manger or any formal training on any of the technology I am working on. So its important to love what I do and always having some targets to achieve.
EDIT 1: A lot of people asking about how they can start their career into Data Science. Though there are a lot of material available in terms of videos, online training, e-books etc.
Though I believe best way to learn is to get your hands dirty. Start solving some Machine learning problem right away and learn while solving problem.
I will say just install Python or R and start solving problem. And just follow these 2 websites they have all tutorials, learning path, problems, data, community. No need to take any paid training.
Still I will be happy to help if I could to any specific doubt.

Are men all about body and face for woman?	"Boys usually are. As they grow up and gain experience, values and priorities change. Some remain boys, of course. Anyway, there?õ????s a saying which applies to all questions starting with ?õ????are all X?õ?????õ???ù:
All generalizations are wrong, including this one.
There?õ????s a whole lot of people in this world, and they?õ????re all quite different. Although there are some trends you can observe, and many men find appearance important, how important it is to them and how much value they place on other qualities is a broad range and you can find people both in the middle and the extremes, just as in anything else. Meaning, some people will only care about appearance, others won?õ????t give a damn about it, and most will be somewhere in the middle.
I can?õ????t think of a relevant study to quote, but I believe in this, just as in many other things, there?õ????s a normal distribution curve with the majority of people being somewhere in the middle and a smaller number of outliers in both directions.

Can you be immortal and still be human?	"A2A. Every physical entity will have its useful life cycle. Whether it is 30 years, 50 years, 70 years, 100 years, 500 years, 1000 years or 10,000 years, it is only an extension of the physical body.
A human form from 1000 years ago is vastly different from that which is modern. Think about the catastrophic events in human history, such as prolonged wars and plagues and other devastating diseases and circumstances, that have shaped our genome.
Even if we could, would we want the same body for 1000 years?
Take a look at your cellphone. Would you want that same cellphone even 5 years from now, let alone 10 or 20?!
Is a ?õ????conscience?õ???ù human? As far as the usefulness of an extension of a physical life, it really reaches some limit. I can only imagine that a ?õ????conscience?õ???ù, a collection of memories, associations, knowledge, personality traits, behavioral tendencies, philosophies even, could be immortal.
So no. The possibility of immortality will not exist in a human form alone ?õ???? it must exist in some type of profile that can be captured in memory.

So keep those lines of communication open and love each other with all the quirkiness that life throws your way. I insist that the craziness every couple goes through is what makes it worthwhile.

How is it still free will if God allows people to be born knowing already they'll go to hell?	"There is a significant gap between God?õ????s knowledge and God?õ????s will or decision.
Regarding the latter, it can be true that if God wants something to be done there would not be any free will for human but concerning the former, there is not any contradiction between God?õ????s knowledge and human?õ????s will since God knows what humans will do based on their own freedom.
For instance, when you know someone well and are certain in advance that the person will commit a crime and will be punished by low, does your knowledge forces him to do as you know? Can the person [after committing the crime] claim that I did not have free will owning to your knowledge? Absolutely not.
Why?
Since you just were aware that s/he will do the crime willingly and you did not force him/her.
In addition, the freedom of human is obvious and undeniably, everyone can feel it.
Note, only some of the humans will go to the hell and the others will go to heaven.

Can you build a house without a foundation?	"Absolutely: pilings/piers/stilts. Think of the way a pier or deck is built. Posts are planted in the ground and joists are attached. Look at houses built in major flood plains or coastal areas, where the house rests well up and off the ground. These houses are not built on foundations, but rather stilts/posts on pilings.
My father built his home on pier blocks because a foundation would have been prohibitively expensive. His home has lasted 40 years without incident. A pier block is basically a big brick that rests on the ground. You place these every X feet and at the corners of your house?õ????s frame and you?õ????re good to go.

How much current can I pass through a copper wire with a section of 3mm^2?	"There?õ????s pretty much no limit until the wire melts and you have enough voltage. Remember the resistance goes up about .4% per degree C so it may be self limiting at some point.
YOu have to figure on two levels. What is the power dissipated for the resistance at a given voltage. And as the power is dissipated the wire will heat up according to thermodynamics, its thermal resistance coupled to air - still or moving makes a big difference. As you calculate the temperature you will then need to calculate the new resistance and current and recalculate the temperature until it reaches equilibrium or runs away (at which point it melted). If it reaches equilibrium you note the current and then increase the voltage until you reach the temperature at which the wire melts.
Two more limits: We assume the wire is suspended in air with no insulation as the insulation increases the thermal resistance and makes it raise temperture faster, plus, the insulation will usually melt before the wire causeing system failures but not wire failures.
Thats the maximum.

What advice do you have for beginning flute players?	"I won't repeat most of the other advice on here, since it's all good and doesn't need to be said again. However, it would be beneficial to begin learning scales and arpeggios and practice them often. Flutes and other woodwinds use scales/arpeggios a LOT in just about every form of music they feature. A well done scale sounds impressive, too.
Start slow, getting clear tones on each note before moving to the next. Gradually speed up the scale/arpeggios, and I mean GRADUALLY. Don't hurry. This process will take days, more likely weeks, to perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect performance, so if you make a mistake start over. Eventually a wonderful little thing called finger memory (or muscle memory) happens, and you'll be able to play those scales faster and with more ease.
Hope this helps. Happy playing!

Do you think Daenerys and Tyrion survive till the end?	"Apparently, this pair was supposed to have been two of the ?õ????final five?õ???ù
It is difficult to assess how much of GRR Martin?õ????s original plans for his characters, remain unchanged.
It is also noteworthy that despite Martin?õ????s claims that he has occasionally planned to change the script regarding some of his key plotlines, he has not always followed these claims through. For instance, he did not alter Jon Snow?õ????s heritage due to fan speculation, despite hinting that he might.
The first book in the Song of Ice and Fire series was released circa 1996 - HBO acquired the televised rights in around 2008?õ????9.
Question is really, how much of the plot has changed between 1996 and 2009, because my understanding was that as book series was only at its midway point in 2009, an agreement was hammered out to ensure that both the TV show and the book series ended the same way, and I imagine that when considering characters as pivotal as Jon, Dany and Tyrion, there would be some agreement that their book and show fates would remain the same.
Here are my predictions.
Tyrion is supposedly Martin?õ????s favourite character, so I personally rate his prospects of surviving to the end, as very high.
The fates of Dany and Jon are far more complex, because while I expect one of them to survive, I doubt they will both make it, but here are my thoughts.
I believe (narrowly) that Dany will survive to the end, although there are some hints within the narrative that she might not.
For instance, we have a hint made by Mirri Maz Duur that Drogo will only be as he was when the seas go dry, the mountains blow like leaves in the wind, the sun rises in the east and Dany bears a living child. This could easily imply that Dany will die in childbirth.
However, it is important to note that these lines were taken from the first book in 1996, and at this point, Martin had decided that Dany would be one of the show?õ????s ultimate survivors - so it is difficult to assess what weight to attribute to Mirri?õ????s words.
We also have the prophecy told by Quaithe. Much has been said of the betrayals, treasons and mounts ?õ????to love?õ???ù, but at this stage, I would say there is insufficient evidence from the text to suggest that this means she will be killed by one whom she loves; indeed, she could actually be the one who must do the killing (if required); as she did with Drogo.
Another clue is the Maggy the Frog prophecy told to Cersei. Someone will cast Cersei down and take all that she holds dear.
If this event occurs in season 8, rather than season 7, I would bet my bottom dollar on this person being Dany. The reasons I believe this to be the case is that there are reportedly only thirteen episodes left in the entire series, where numerous events are to take place by the end. Dany is the only person right now with the resources, support and power to take down Cersei - Sansa has not got this sort of power, neither has Brienne or Arya.
It is entirely possible that this person could actually be Jon (seeing as the gender of the person was not revealed, and being possibly from Asshai, Maggy may have intended for the prophecy to be gender-neutral).
However, again, I don?õ????t think there is enough time for Jon to accumulate that sort of power and take down Cersei by season 8. For another thing, I doubt anyone south of the vale has heard of him and would much probably less support him as King of the Seven kingdoms. For this scenario, I think the TV show will follow the straight-forward narrative and opt for Dany as Cersei?õ????s adversary (particularly given her fan following).
Lastly, Jon. Much as I?õ????d love to say that I think he will survive, I doubt he will.
For one thing, Martin has sort of confirmed that GoT will follow a similar narrative to Lord of the Rings.
In that trilogy, Frodo?õ????s life was temporarily spared following an attack by the Nazguls, which enabled him to fulfill his mission before he was finally at peace.
Similarly, as with Frodo, I believe that Jon has been brought back for a purpose following his death at the Wall; and I doubt that this purpose somehow involves sitting on the Iron throne.

OVC Overcast. The sky is entirely covered with clouds.

If you learn C++ you will eventually learn most of C with some differences between the languages that you will learn over time. In fact its a very hard thing to write proper C++ because intermediate C++ programmers tend to write C/C++.That is true whether or not you started with C or started with C++.
If you know C first, then that is good plus to learning C++. You will start with knowing a chunk of the language. If you do not know C first then there is no point focusing on a different language. There are plenty of good books and tutorials available that start you from knowing nothing and will cover anything you would learn from C which applies to C++ as well.

How do I get free room offers in Las Vegas like my parents do?	"The answer, as others have said, is simply to gamble.
Sign up for a rewards program at whatever casino(or group of casinos) you like, then hand your players card to the pit boss every time you sit down to play, place it in the machine every time you play, and present it every time you pay for anything inside one of the casinos.
I know from talking to my hosts at a few properties that they can generally comp about 30?õ????40% of the amount that you are expected to, or do, risk per trip.
I primarily play at CET properties now, since I hit the Seven Stars status with them a couple years ago, and they are phenomenal about comping everything.
If this is your first trip, don't expect to get much of anything free if you've never played before. You won't be getting a free weekend trip just by signing up. However, if you play enough to warrant being assigned a host, or play enough to hit a status allowing you to use the VIP check in you can get in touch with the host on duty(there is always one on duty), they can usually comp your stay and anything you've charged to you room at check out. That being said, if you're asking them to comp $1,000 for you, you should probably have quite an impressive amount of coin-in or a high table rating.
You can also apply for the total rewards visa, or the mLife master card. Either of those give you an automatic middle of the road status with either players club, but that's about the same status you could get by taking a few grand to gamble with and having a bit of luck before you lose it.

Should I pay for other's healthcare when I can barely afford my own?	"Only if you want health insurance. The alternative is saving your money to pay only your own expenses. No paying for things you will never need, but also no one to pay for your sudden unexpected expenses.
If people could accurately predict all their future medical expenses they would not need insurance. So we rely on a big group of people of various ages and levels of health to put money in, with the idea that there will be enough healthy people to make up for the unhealthy ones at any given time.
Look at it this way: The person whose sex change you are paying for now, may end up paying for your car accident/heart attack/cancer next week or next year or next decade. Or not. The point is you don?õ????t know, that is why you have insurance.

Why do the Greeks still claim that Istanbul is theirs?	"All throughout the modern Greek state?õ????s history we have been ?õ????educated?õ???ù into believing that the Eastern Roman Empire, Byzantium was in reality a Greek Empire.

If the government stopped providing clean water and electricity what would be the best way to survive?	"Electricity is not provided by the government. Water only in some places.
Where I live there is lots of water near my house. Springs come out everywhere. My house is on a local service out of wells. Water is really not a problem even if we have to carry it to the house in a bucket.
My area also has many little hydro plants that have bee abandoned, that I am sure local people would cut the lines going elsewhere and get these dams going in short order. My small community would isolate ourselves from the grid and power the area with generators for a while.
Sewage would be a problem because it takes a lot of electricity. Plants in towns will quickly start running raw sewage into the streams. I am on my own sewage drain field. I need nothing.
So to answer your question, it would depend on where you live. If your are in a city and/or know little about how things work, then your best bet is to head towards the nearest place that has people who do know. Get there early because because we are going to give you a gun and pull guard duty while we are busy getting the lights to run again. Be late and you will be shot by whoever got your guard duty job because at some point we will have to shut off the flow of people into the few places that do get power going.
Maybe you mean the government shuts off water and power just because they could. In that case government worker jobs will start getting hazardous pay.

How much can we earn (minimum and maximum) in Android game developing in India?	"Okay, I recently published my first game on the play store and I had thought that since Play store is a global market, the amount I get will be pretty good due to my earnings also coming from developed countries in western Europe and US. I was dead wrong. The entire amount of money you make is dependent on your impression CPM. Basically, it is the amount of money you get for every 1000 impressions(a loaded ad is an impression). Even though my game got pretty awesome downloads and was getting a lot of impressions compared to first games released by developers. So, here is why and how much loss you will incur and how to do something about it.
When I first released my game, my impression CPM was around $55. As soon as I got more downloads, my impression CPM dropped a lot. and very very quickly. It soon got less than $1. and then less than $0.1 . Right now it is $0.28. This is because advertisers in India don?õ????t pay a lot for their adverts in apps. Mainly because this stuff is kinda still new to India. I talked to someone I know who posts Youtube videos, and he told me that it is essential to have viewers in other countries than India. He told me that the impression CPM for countries like Qatar etc. is around $80 dollars and with only 7?õ????8 regular viewers in Qatar, he has made 8000 rupees(I don?õ????t remember in how long). Some countries even have impression CPMs as high as $150. This kinda sucks for Indians because when you post on Facebook or ask your friends to download it, most of your reach will only be in India.
The loss is obvious in the previous example. It is pretty huge.
I don?õ????t have a lot of amazing(or, in fact, anything that isn?õ????t blatantly obvious) ways but simply put, advertise on reddit or 9gag or write a blog helping others and mention your app or put links in Quora after helpful answers(like I am going to do right now :P). It isn?õ????t wrong to advertise like this. Especially if you are helping someone. The way I see it, nobody loses anything, some random person gets help, you promote your app. Everybody wins.
I don?õ????t know about maximum but if your game is good, it could definitely be as popular as any other game. And it is not impossible to make a huge amount of money from android games. I mean, flappie bird was also developed by a small team, I couldn?õ????t see how a indian team couldn?õ????t do that. Though, from what I have experienced, the start may be slow. Minimum is probably zero, if not exactly zero, then very close to it at least.

The computer was configured (programmed) to perform a specific computation, then started up and allowed to run. To run a different program, the plugboards had to be changed.

Should marital rape be decriminalised and why?	"Absolutely not.
Rape is rape. Adding the word ?õ????marital?õ???ù in front of it doesn't undermine the severity of the crime.
Frankly, a marriage license does not give you a free pass to your partners body whenever it is you crave. Marriage does not take away the constant need for consent. Marriage does not give one power over another without repercussions. Signing a marriage contract does not include signing off your bodily rights.
The misconception that sexual violations can't take place in a marriage is extremely misconstrued, and must be revised.

Their costumes help add more intrigue into their music, by completely relieving themselves of the burdens of identity they can truly embrace the roles as messengers who are here to deliver messages about the birth, rise, life and yet to come bits about the anti-Christ.
Their showmanship is taken to a whole new level by just the simple act of concealing their identities.

Why do people upvote only the answers written by popular writers?	"It's wrong to say that people only upvote answers written by popular writers. People upvote when they like the content of your answers. But yes, popular writers usually get more upvotes than the rest and I can think of few reasons for this:
However, in my personal opinion quora is much more than just upvotes. It is an amazing platform to share your knowledge with others and let them know about your opinion. It would lose its charm if it's just about upvote gathering. So stop worrying about upvotes. Keep reading, keep writing, keep sharing,keep evolving and may be someday you too might become a popular writer on quora. Good luck :)

What was the role of Tsar Nicholas II in WWI?	"He actually had two roles in the war - one he kept until his abdication and the other that he assumed well after the war started. Keeping the one he was probably OK, but in assuming the other he committed several blunders, which cost him his throne and eventually his life and the lives of his entire immediate family.
The man on the left is Nicholas II, Tsar of all the Russias. The imposing man on his right is Grand Duke Nikolay Nikolayevich, the Tsar?õ????s uncle, who stood 6 feet 6 inches tall, and was the Tsar?õ????s commanding officer when Nicholas was first in the army as the crown prince.
At the start of the First World War, Tsar Nicholas II was NOT the commander of the Russian Army, his uncle was. This was by design, to distance the Tsar from political blame if the war went badly and to allow him to maintain political control in St. Petersburg. By the end of 1914, with the defeat by the Germans at Tannenburg and Masurian Lakes, but with some partial success against the Austrian Hungarian armies in Galicia, this arrangement wasn?õ????t too badly handled.
Then in late spring of 1915 the Germans began an operation which collapsed the Russian front and began a ?õ????Great Retreat?õ????, conquering all of present day Poland and pushing into Belarus and Ukraine.
In September, Nicholas took action. The Grand Duke was relieved of his command and the Tsar took direct control of his army.
Unfortunately, he was not up to both tasks of running the Army in its present state, nor effectively leading the country. So he decided to run the Army first, and leave as much as he could to Tsarina Alexandra - his German born wife who had little to no support or confidence of the Russian upper nobility or ministers, yet continued to act in her husband?õ????s stead leaning on some rather strange characters and notables for moral and political support.
Including this guy.
Needless to say, both the affairs at the front and the home front in 1916 worsened considerably, leaving no one but the Tsar to take the blame - on the one hand for being in direct control of the military failures, and on the other for NOT governing back home like he should.
By February 1917 the country had enough, revolted and called for the abdication of the Tsar. However, the Kerensky government made a fateful decision to continue the war in 1917, and in response to what looked like a clear mutiny of a portion of the Army made a further fatal mistake by asking the Bolsheviks to help defend St. Petersburg and even going so far as to arm them out of government coffers.
In October, the Bolsheviks took the opportunity given to them on a silver platter, staged a second revolution/coup of their own and took charge of the country for the next 73 years.
Eight months later, in a little farmhouse barn near Yekaterinburg east of the Ural mountains, Nicholas, Alexandra and all of their children were summarily shot together by their Bolshevik guards.

(sorry i couldn?õ????t resist) Therefore the right side of the brain is extorted to the maximum but only when performing tasks that are coherently to be calibrated in the apparatus of the left brain.

But rarely for the sake of appreciating the said art.

How badass is the United States military?	"It?õ????s incredibly badass, but not for the reasons everyone else is talking about. It?õ????s not just the training and equipment, those are amazing. It?õ????s the level of trust and authority given to the enlisted personnel. It?õ????s something practically unheard of just about anywhere else, except maybe the Brits and Aussies (to my knowledge). So taking your hypothetical scenario, old USSR vs the U.S. and providing a story told to me from someone who lived it.
Here?õ????s a story from a retired Air Force Colonel told to me about 10 years ago?õ????
He was working with a nuclear disarmament group in the early 90s shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union. Essentially, the Americans would go to the Russian bases, and watch them methodically destroy missiles, and the Russians would come to the U.S. and do the same.
When he was in Russia, there was a Specialist (E-4 equivalent) on a torch cutting up the missile. He was supervised by an E-5 or E-6, who was supervised by an E-7, who then had 4 officers dictating everything that would happen while furiously chain smoking. Finally, a General would be overseeing the whole thing, and micromanaging from the catwalk above.
At the end of this, the Americans got a tour of Russian bases and services. They saw Russian tanks, jets, and ships all do their thing. The same pattern was repeated everywhere they went. Officers were micromanaging, and little freedom is given down the chain. Enlisted personnel were little more than button pushers with no real power or influence.
The Russians came to the U.S. and were astonished at how few people we used to accomplish the same tasks. Then they toured the American military facilities.
They saw Army tank formations and drills, and couldn?õ????t believe that every tank wasn?õ????t brimming with Officers.
They went to an Air Force base, and wanted to see who was in charge of the flight line, and were astonished, that not only was the person in charge of the flight line an enlisted person it was also (gasp!) a WOMAN!
Finally, they went to an aircraft carrier and observed flight operations. They were insistent that there had to be officers down there directing the planes, and launching them. ?õ????No sir, all the Officers are either on the catwalk, or here in the tower.?õ???ù They demanded to go down and meet the guy they thought was in charge (if I remember right a Brown or Yellow shirt). They were shocked to find that this person was an E-4 or E-5 (if that).
I remember the Colonel telling me that one Russian General was very quiet on the flight back. After a couple vodkas he confessed, ?õ????I had no idea your enlisted people did all of that. If we had known that all those films weren?õ????t just propaganda, the Cold War would have been over decades ago.?õ???ù There was just no way that the Soviet?õ????s top-down structure could compete with the initiative, training, and trust given at even the lowest ranks of the American military.
I remember as an E-3 (no joke), being asked to provide inputs for tasking the U-2 and Predator overflights in a combat zone. I provided them, they were tasked for the next series of fights. I was shocked that I was even asked this question, much less that they used my inputs!
So I ask you, how badass is it that a military puts that much trust in people who have only been in the military, in many cases less than a year, and still accomplishes its missions every day? Pretty badass I?õ????d say?õ????

Why has a rideshare service not been made specifically for college students where college students are the drivers?	"Ask any college student what is the premium to rent a car from a rental agency? Uber and Lyft are thriving ride share services because a great deal of college students do not have personal transportation or are not allowed to bring the vehicle to campus. Factor in the peer pressure to provide the ride all the time, and remain sober enough to get everyone home safely- while being financially libel if an accident occurs, and another mode of transportation starts to seem responsible for a group of young people who may be the smartest most unresponsive people collected together. Universities don't want the extra burden of providing transportation beyond the campus other than any off campus residence halls considered apart of the Campus Plan.
I have heard of students funding off campus housing expenses driving for ride sharing services in college areas, so there is a market. I hope this helps.
Good luck!

With algorithmic changes hitting Instagram feeds, posting quality images and profile pics has become even more important. Indeed, Instagram accounts that post superior graphics have been found to get away with higher frequency.
Moreover, Instagram web users respond favorably to a select few filters. As per research done at Georgia Tech and Yahoo Labs, filtered photos are 21% more likely to get viewed and 45% more likely to get comments.
So, which filters work the best?
Track Maven found that using ?õ????no filter?õ???ù and ?õ????Inkwell?õ???ù in your photos will drive the most interaction.
While the above filters are good starting points for experimentation, your audience might have a different favorite filter.
You need to dig into your own account?õ????s performance, using a tool like Iconosquare.
Once you get your own graphs correlating engagement with filters, you?õ????ll be able to judge your audience preferences. If you are just starting out with Instagram and don?õ????t have a large following, study your competitors to see what?õ????s working for them.
Pro Tip: Do you know that Instagram also allows users to post up to 15 seconds of video content? But, as per April 2015 research by Locowise, only 10.81% of Instagram posts are in video format. Yet, they get 17.51% of all comments.
This is an untapped opportunity for you to increase engagement by using your Instagram account well. Get started with Instagram video here.

"If Americans value so much sports in high school and college, why do 2 out of 3 of them become overweight or obese as adults?"	"Football has always been a mainstay in American Culture, but many don?õ????t play it as it can cause brain/head trauma, and sports represent a significant part of our culture.
But explaining the overweight/obesity epidemic?
I think it has to do with the food in our country. Food manufacturers chemically alter so that it stimulates all of our taste buds, and we crave more and more of it. Like Pavlov?õ????s Dogs, we are classically conditioned to eat foods that stimulate or taste buds, and the sight of a cheeseburger can move our digestive juices. A plate of Sriracha Bacon Fries will leave you hooked far more than a plate of boiled potatoes. A bag of cheetos puffs contains MSG as a flavor enhancer, and the dissolving mechanism leads to infinite eating as your body cant register you being full. Also, television stimulates hunger neurons in the brain, encouraging overeating.

What connection does Android use when both WiFi and mobile data are simultaneously enabled?	"Basically, it depends on speed of then network and its nature. For ex. there is a wifi connected and its showing in task bar sign in to wifi network that means the android consider it limited so data will be used.

You?õ????d think it?õ????s enough to figure out how to begin a relationship, finish school, begin a career, and find a place of our own for the first time.
Oh, but life has a mind of its own!
We have to figure out how to maintain all our relationships (dating, family, and friends), finish school without knowing many basic ?õ????real-life?õ???ù concepts, pay our bills, go to work, ?õ????the list goes on.
When does it not make you tired anymore?
Here?õ????s what you can do to simplify:
Here?õ????s an example.
Debt in your 20s: Your challenge is a student loan. When your loans become due, you pay them. You get a job and proactively pay your student loans so you don?õ????t fall behind on them.
Debt in your 30s: Your challenge is a home mortgage. When your mortgage become due, you pay it. You have a job and stay on top of your mortgage so you don?õ????t fall behind on it.
To sum it all up?õ????
Becoming an adult is a tiring process if you don?õ????t give your actions some thought. Simplify what you can so you can enjoy your life.
Spend more time doing the things you love and less time on the rest.

What is the academic pressure and workload at Drexel University like?	"Much like the other answer here, it depends on what major you are. However I would like to point out something: Drexel is predominantly an engineering school. This is what Drexel absolutely excels at.
That being said: I'm a computer science major. I have a 3.3 GPA right now, and usually do 13?õ????14 credits a quarter. A typical study day goes something like this:

How do you know that the person you have trusted is true?	"People have many theories about how you can know whether the person you are trusting is truthful.
But let me tell you about my experience, and a practical advice -
?õ????You can?õ????t?õ???ù.
You can?õ????t read anyone?õ????s mind or control the circumstances around them. So you can?õ????t guarantee when or what they change their mind to, and what circumstances that they face which make them take actions which will make them take decisions that you may consider as breach of trust.
I will conclude with this one example -
I have been working with this business person, he always sounded very genuine. He used to make promises and many a times failed to deliver them. Many a times it happened because he willingly turned his back on his promises stating one reason or another. Despite being genuine (sometimes), whatever took his fancy, he justified his reasons and deceived on people (as per him, it was right thing to do, but the recipient took it as deception).
So, working with him taught me that, you have to trust people in many cases, and you should when needed, or you don?õ????t have any option.
But,
Always keep a a check on the corner cases. After all, it is better to be skeptical than sorry.

What is your most embarrassing moment in front of the whole class?	"We were in the first year of engineering and my friend was in the ECE (Electronics and Communication ) branch and they had their ED (Engineering Drawing) class along with the CSE( Computer Science).
The ED Prof. was a pain-in-the-a** who wouldn't let anyone enter in his class after him and he would always reach his class at 8:00 a.m.
One day, his class started as usual at 8:00 a.m. and almost everyone including my friend was present inside the class. A rare thing happened, a cs student got late by few minutes and she dared to wait there to grab his attention so that he would see her standing outside and allow her to enter.
As destiny would have it, my friend saw her there and found out she was his crush. As it is in engineering colleges, few girls are famous initially, who are the hot topic on campus and everyone seems to be talking about them.
Now my friend was eyeing her. While teaching Prof. observed this and looked in the direction he was staring and found out an exquisite creature standing just outside his class waiting for his mercy to let her in. God knows what tempted him but he allowed her to get in.
As she started walking towards an empty seat, my friend was watching her without knowing the fact that prof. was viewing him and along with prof. Whole class was witnessing him staring at her. As she walked towards her seat, my friend's neck kept on rotating until she sat on her bench.
When she grabbed her seat and my friend looked at the prof. who was waiting for it. Prof. then started laughing and said ""

What will the future of the Congress and Rahul Gandhi be?	"Answer:
Congress has to do some serious introspection.
Rahul Gandhi for the good of congress and to stop further embarrassing himself has to retire from politics and sit at home.
Let us understand the basic difference between Congress and the current BJP.
The current BJP has an ideology, whereas congress has more or less been an umbrella organisation which takes in all rotten eggs in one basket, or it has been reduced to one.
Added to the above, Congress has been reduced to family fiefdom of particular political people.
To come out of all this it has to bring something new to the people or something new should be offered to people.
The BJP has kept Hindutva at it?õ????s core and projected itself as the sole proprietor of
These things are much better on the table or an offing to the public, rather than what the congress has to offer.
The Congress always offers lip service to the so called pseudo-secularism that it follows and starts pandering to vote bank politics.
Congress also simply takes everyone along, as far as achieving it?õ????s goal. It doesn?õ????t stand out in the crowd.
The RSS-BJP on the other hand, has strongly built cadres everywhere in the country.
The congress still relies on party workers, who have to purchased. Whose loyalty can simply wither away if they are angry about a party leader or the smallest of scuffle. Where as the RSS can simply commandeer the Swayamsevaks at their beck and call. The swayamsevaks offer unquestionable loyalty to the RSS.
So the future of Congress is rehabilitation, rejuvanation and reinvention.
Where for Rahul Gandhi it should be retirement, rest, renunciation from politics.

Where I can get raw material for fashion accessory making?	"It depends on the kind of accessories and gender specific items you wish to manufacture. Normally accessories for Ladies are more in number and in variety than men.
If it's bags, clutches, vanities or purses for women, there are a variety of raw materials you can use. For leather you can source from Chennai, Kolkata, Kanpur or Agra. For jute ,it's obviously Kolkata. For cotton ( depending on texture and material) , Surat, Ahmedabad, Kohlapur, Tirpur etc. Same applies to belts or shoes. For costume jewelry, some North Eastern states make fantastic products; you can simply buy them. Otherwise for silver you can get workmen ( karigar) from Bengal. Terracotta from Bankura & Bishnupur in Bengal. For fancy items Delhi and Mumbai.
You will need almost same materials for men's shoes, sandals, purse, pouch and belts. So the sources of raw material will be the same.
Watches form a big part of accessories, both men and women. If you really want to dish out a novel product, you may have to get it specifically designed by watchmakers.

What is varicose veins? Is there any cure for it?	"WARNING! Following answer may contain disturbing images
?õ????Varicose vein?õ???? is a condition characterised by dilated or engorged veins due to pooling of blood in them. The dilation of the veins is due to the pressure exerted by the blood in them.
The engorged veins are a result of obstruction of major veins by a thrombus (blood clot) or by a atherosclerotic plaque (deposit of cholesterol).
Varicose veins may be harmless to really dangerous depending on the underlying cause. If you have varicose veins then I suggest you consult with a doctor right away.
The relief of varicose veins may be by implantation of a venous graft (a grafted vein from somewhere else in the body).
Hope this helps!

Which thing hurt the most?	"We may have gone over this thought in our head every time we had that break up. Every time our friend crushed us by back stabbing. Every time we forgave our jilted lover only to be cheated again. So many times yet we learn nothing. Why? Because we never have a Dialogue with ourselves Asking WHY does someone who love Us hurt us?
Let?õ????s go back to when we were young, vibrant and waiting to experience Life. We made that One Best Friend who we thought will love us through thick and thin. And then, One fine day something happens and Snap ?õ???? your Friendship is Over. You don?õ????t know what you might have said or done that could be so agonising that years built on trust, faith and innocence took only a second to break. You were the same Best friend who had always been there no matter what. Then, what changed?
Nothing. Period.
Here?õ????s why:
All the while you thought that the foundation of your friendship was being built and this was the best friend you could fall back on ?õ???? you were in fact, falling in the scheme of things. Someone who his/her parents loved, someone who would always be there to help with the homework, someone who would always give a listening ear, someone who was adored by the boyfriend/girlfriend, and lastly someone who Always kept the SECRETS. Always. So, either one day or gradually, your BF figured that you were no longer falling in the scheme of things, it was time to Move on. Without a word.
It may not seem a real reason but when you analyse your situation and look deeper, you surprisingly have the answers you never thought of. If your best friend had lost his/her parents while it was still time to hit the playground with Dad or accompany Mom to the grocery store ?õ???? you can think ahead and assess that THAT was not a normal childhood. Given such circumstances, either your best friend had to shoulder a lot of responsibilities from a young age only to become a serious & mature person before time or didn?õ????t care a damn about anything or anyone.
So, we come back to the same point ?õ???? that while you thought you were undeniably the bestest of people this person has met, You were merely a source of joy. What your best friend had seen, toughened him/her up up to the point of either being Unbreakable or Breaking at the drop of a hat. Either case, you suffer the Aftermath.
Now, we come to a time in your life when you seek Love.
Love from the opposite sex. Unconditional, Passionate and Sizzling LOVE. For as long as you?õ????ve known, everyone falls in and out of Love. Its time you experience it too. So, you meet someone you?õ????re attracted to, start dating, fall in Love and are crazy about each other. And then one day, you get to know that your lover Cheated on you. You ask yourself all sorts of questions like Why me? Was I a sucker in bed? Was I bad looking? Yet, you don?õ????t Ask yourself the real reasons.
Real reasons like the above ones. Real reasons like the below ones:
You?õ????ve just met this person and you are already dreaming of marrying him/her. You jump the gun, try everything to impress this person and when you?õ????re cheated on ?õ???? you feel miserable. Look back at the start and you know that your expectations right from the beginning were unrealistic. When it was time to take it slow, you kept craving and begging for more. When it was time to understand what he/she is saying, you were building love castles in the air. When it was time to step back a little, you were suffocating this person with Love.Love.Love. And then before you know it ?õ???? you received a smack in the face when he/she went around to have some fun. C?õ????mon! What were you thinking?
More often than not, when you find THE ONE, your world revolves around this person. Little do you realise that this person eventually feels like he/she is going out with a finer version of the self. You think by doing this, you display the Ultimate selflessness and beat Romeo & Juliet at Love. But, think about it. Would you love someone who had no Identity except for Being Mr. X?õ????s Love/Ms. X?õ????s love? No. Being individualistic, strong, independent and opinionated makes you desirable. Not frolicking around your Love as if you are a Pet.
Whether it?õ????s your BF or lover- you have got to communicate your feelings. When we open the door of a dialogue ?õ???? we open our hearts. Carrying the burden of unspoken words can take a toll on you. Instead of always telling this person you love them ?õ???? why, how, always will and so on..Tell this person what you feel. Feel when you are rejected. Feel about your ambitions. Feel about your environment. It is amazing to see how friendships and Love can be unsurmountable only by letting your feelings out. But, we rarely do this. So when we are close to that break up ?õ???? we bleed from inside but still don?õ????t say how we feel.
Next time when you are hurting from a break up, think about these reasons rather than ?õ???? Why me? Here is the powerful opportunity for you see your past relationships in a different light. Dont give up. Take the cue and move forward. To new Best friends. To New Love.

Is it OK to try meth once?	"Short answer: stay off that stuff unless you have a death wish.
I?õ????ve given this some thought and research in the past, largely because drugs fascinate me scientifically, and you can?õ????t know how they actually feel without taking them. So, curiosity is basically my motivation.
My conclusion is that, in the case of meth, a lot depends on how and why you take it. Injecting yourself with street drugs is never safe, so I would recommend anyone to avoid doing that.
Smoking or snorting meth also renders its effects stronger than if you eat it.
Methamphetamine has been approved by the FDA for treating ADHD in adults and children (!) and obesity. But obviously they?õ????re taking pills, not snorting, injecting or smoking meth. And its not clear that it actually helps in the long term.
So eating the stuff in very small, carefully-measured quantities (bearing in mind that an overdose could be fatal), would seem the safest option.
My own conclusion is that I wouldn?õ????t even want to do that. I don?õ????t trust myself not to think ?õ????wow, that was great, maybe I?õ????ll try it again when I urgently need an energy boost, but only for some very important reason?õ???ù.
Once you started thinking like that about an addictive drug, you?õ????re quite likely to eventually end up addicted. And meth is notoriously addictive and notoriously damaging to health.
Many addicts start off with a safe and harmless usage pattern, but move to a more obviously troublesome pattern and more harmful methods of ingestion after some time.
Neither would I want to take the stuff if my concentration was shot to pieces. There are other drugs I?õ????d rather try before taking a methamphetamine prescription. I?õ????m not convinced its effects on the brain are on balance beneficial for most people, even if they might be in the short term.
There are a ton of people who?õ????ve tried meth and never returned to it, or who take it in some safe usage pattern. But are you sure you?õ????re going to be one of them, and not the guy who ends up living in some filthy squat with HIV and various meth-induced mental disorders? I wouldn?õ????t want to take the chance, knowing myself as I do. I already made that mistake with cigarettes!

How cool are the all new Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+?	"Source :
The samsung has replaced physical buttons with the software on-screen buttons. This has helped samsung to increase the screen body ratio . But the samsung on-screen buttons does not look pretty and the device has to lose a physical home button.
On the Samsung Galaxy S8 the fingerprint reader has moved to the back of the phone near camera . As both the phones are taller enough so one has to stretch the hand everytime to reach the fingerprint sensor or have to use both hands . Other phones like Google Pixel also have fingerprint sensor at back side but they fits better in hand.
There is 3000mAH battery on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and 3500mAH battery on the S8 Plus . The battery size is not large for such a 5.8 inch vibrant large display . Even the mid-range Phones are providing better and large battery size . Battery size will be a big draw back of this device.
Camera on the Samsung Galaxy S8 is same as was on previous Galaxy S7. Launching a new device but keeping the same specs is not a good thing. Users wants to update everything if they are switching to a new device.
Samsung Galaxy S8 does not come up with the stock android . It uses samsung UX on the top of the Android 7.0 with custom features. Stock Android works far better than custom UI as they are more stable and are tested along the best hardware. OnePlus uses Stock android and their Phones gives better performance.
Bixby is the new personnel assistance for the Samsung devices . It does all the same things that Google assistance does . It shows the bunch of cards of relevant data as the Google does . The phone also contains Google Now . Why if they have their own assistance ?

"In Warhammer 40k, which loyal legion or chapter is more involved with what's happening in the galaxy?"	"There are no Legions in the 40k universe that are Loyal. There are only Traitor Legions, and Loyal Chapters. The whole point of the Codex Astartes was to make sure no single warlord had command over a force as devastating as 10000 Space Marines. So if one chapter ever got out of hand, they could be subdued.
However, the most involved Chapter in the galaxy would be the Black Templars. The Black Templars are the only chapter that has been unaffected by the Codex Astartes, because they don?õ????t recruit from one planet, but simply from wherever their crusades might take them. Since their chapter has hundred of crusades, it is predicted that the chapter has over 10,000 brothers. The reason they aren?õ????t curtailed, is because of how spread out the chapter is, each company fighting it?õ????s own personal crusade. Since the Black Templar have over 10,000 brothers, and crusades in every segment of the galaxy, they are 100% the most involved chapter in the Imperium. There were some on Armageddon, there were some at Cadia, there are some in the Domacles Crusade, there are some fighting Hive Fleet Leviathan, there are some fighting Necrons, there are some?õ???? yeah you get it.

"Does Athena Walker get tired of answering psychopath questions that are clearly about personality traits, not psychopaths?"	"It is tiring, yes. However, I do understand that people really have no idea the difference. Psychopathy is not well understood by most people, and when they want to understand it, they do what everyone else does. They Google it.
Google and psychopathy have an acrimonious relationship. Neither of them are at fault really, it?õ????s the people that are uploading the information to Google about psychopathy that are to blame for their bitter war. People trust Google, and Google does it?õ????s job valiantly. They search for information about ?õ????psychopaths?õ???ù and Google industriously brings back information regarding it.
That information is often the unresearched opinions of people that have no background in neurobiology but understand how to write clickbait articles. There are links to quizzes, checklists, articles about the evils within psychopathy, how to identify a psychopath, weird things about psychopaths (the newest apparently being that we have no body odor, and no, that is not a thing) and websites that will tell you all about how to avoid these demons in human skins.
What do they all have in common? They are lacking in actual data, understanding, and they are steeped bias. They also are very catchy and easy to read. People can identify traits that are listed in themselves and think, wait, I have that. Or, my boss, sister, friend, mother, father, every person I have ever known has that! Are they all psychopaths? It says here that they are. Back to Google.
Are all the people I know psychopaths?
or
Am I a psychopath?
Add in the details of that personality trait, and sooner or later they will be led to Quora. Of course this is the perfect venue to ask about the roving psychopath problem that has been so clearly mapped in out their lives. Most people that they know prefer black coffee, so of course they must be psychopathic, because psychopaths prefer bold and bitter flavors.
Does it annoy me? Sure. Then I have to really question what I am annoyed at. The person for asking because they found that a number of sites make claims about psychopaths that are nonsense, or the rampant misinformation that is present. I prefer people critically think, fact check, but expecting them to delve into psychopathy to the point that they can see how misinformed the information they are asking about is unreasonable.
What I am therefore tired of this bastardization of psychopathy to further the ends of people that want to blame other people for bad relationships, or evil deeds in the world. There are people in the world that do really awful things, and some of them are psychopaths. A lot of them are not. However psychopathy is so catchy and interesting, that it seems that people can?õ????t resist making it the fall guy for all things wrong, and everything under the sun, no matter how mundane, becomes a sure fire sign of psychopathy.
So, that tires me. Until that changes the questions will keep coming. I suppose I can look at it this way. At least they are asking, not just deciding that because they see personality or physical trait of X, that it?õ????s as good as a diagnosis. There are people that do this and then proclaim that they ARE a psychopath. A number of those will show up and write as a psychopath here on Quora. They spread misinformation, live to a stereotype, and that?õ?????õ?????õ?????õ?????õ????. that is far more tiresome.

What are good examples of a good commander changing the outcome of a battle entirely during World War 2?	"When Chuikov took over the 62nd Army, in charge of defending the city itself, he faced what looked like a hopeless situation. The Germans were steadily advancing with their combined forces, and the Russians were being steadily forced back into the city with increasing losses and collapsing morale. Being ordered to hold at all costs, he breathed new life in Stalingrad?õ????s defenses by setting up strongpoints well inside the city and up against the Volga, and ordered his troops to keep their front lines as close to the Germans as they could, to negate their advantages of air and artillery power, as they would risk hitting their own troops. Machine gun nests were set up to cover the major streets, and enemy tanks were funneled into narrow corridors where they could be destroyed by anti-tank infantry at close range, often using little more than Molotov cocktails. Thus the Germans were forced to deploy their infantry to fight street by street, block by block, building by building, often capturing and losing and capturing the same objective over and over again. Attempts to bomb the buildings of Stalingrad into wreckage by air and artillery only created more rubble for the Russian defenders to hide in. Even the sewers beneath the city became a battleground. Throughout it all Chuikov remained stubborn as a rock, both in his personal demeanor and how he handled his troops, often exhausted and undersupplied. All his reinforcements came from the other side of the Volga, often fed in piecemeal and sent to the front lines to die in a matter of hours. Chuikov would only retreat his troops from a position long enough to devise a counterattack to retake it. With a fatalism that only a Russian commander in desperate circumstances could possess, Chuikov held fast to his duties and his shrinking sliver of Stalingrad until Zhukov executed his massive enveloping counterattack. Realizing that his mission wasn't suicidal and hopeless after all (Zhukov deliberately kept news of the impending Operation Uranus from his front line commanders to ensure they would fight the Germans hard enough that they wouldn?õ????t notice the preparations), Chuikov continued to keep the German 6th Army engaged in the city until they were fully surrounded and unable to break out, eventually to surrender when their supplies ran out and it was obvious they could not be reinforced. After the German defeat at Stalingrad they rushed to pull their troops out of the Crimea and back to better supplied lines near Kharkov, where they managed to put a temporary halt to the pursuing Russians with Manstein's Backhand Blow, but that's another story.
Zhukov receives most of the credit for the Russian victory at Stalingrad with his execution of the Uranus counterattack that surrounded the German troops inside the city and defeated all attempts to break them out. Yet Uranus would've never happened without the dogged determination of Chuikov, the right commander at the right time, to hold what little he had left in the city at all costs and prevent the Germans from securing their gains.

Why is the voltage not proportional to the current?	"In general, voltage and current _DO_ tend to be proportional.
However, it is better to understand that voltage is the force that causes/pushes the current; the Elecrto Motive Force (EMF). Voltage is the push like pressure pushes water in pipes.
The voltage pushes. The more it pushes (more, or higher voltage), more current will flow. However, the circuit resists that flow. The more the circuit resists the flow, the less current will flow. So there is an inverse relationship between current and resistance.
The current that flows is the result of both the voltage and the resistance of the circuit. The current is proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to current.

What career should I pursue if I want to change the world?

It is this nature that drives us towards the endless, ruthless, exclusive competition, success at the expense of others, exploitation of everything and everybody around ourselves. This nature has become cancer-like in the globally integrated and interdependent world we evolved into.
Thus in order to change the world we need to change our own nature first. But this change needs to happen without coercion, misleading trickery, through positive motivation, willing participation, by showing positive example. And that requires a brand new education, upbringing. Thus the best career I would recommend would be taking part in this brands new, ?õ????integral upbringing?õ???ù.

Are Dravidian parties of Tamil Nadu facing the same fate as Congress?	"Yes. They are experiencing similar downhill travel right now. They became famous because they had someone to blame when they first started. Now they are the ones carrying the blame for so many issues, some of which are irreparable. For example, one such issue will the outdated and dangerously misleading engineering education system which is churning out graduates who do not fit any current popular job descriptions in the industry. they have to work hard on their own to even become eligible for interview. All this after them paying lakhs of rupees taken on educational loans whose interest are compounded. To present a brief argument in that regard, please refer to the tamil short film titled Theory of Engineering for Rs.15 here at
This means that if the people get an option other than the dravidian parties, chances are they will start choosing that party/group. The initial stages will see vote banks being broken by new players and eventually the newcomers will take up the administration. The problem there is that the people of Tamil Nadu gave such parties/individuals a chance to prove their worth and they dropped the ball. They did not deliver as expected and all they did was complain on the dravidian parties. The key factor for winning here, moving forward will be, to publish the allocated budgets for each constituency, indicate the committed liabilities and available funds for new contracts and present an itemized plan for the spending the available budget to counter and prevent the issues faced by the citizens. To begin with, the candidate/party needs an itemized list of problems faced by the people and the list should not have trivial top level problem definitions such as ?õ????fisherman?õ????s issue?õ????. it should in fact have it detailed as ?õ????lack of satellite based maritime surveillance solutions?õ???? which can help Tamilnadu fishermen avoid shootings and legally fish and make a respectable living.

What is the easiest way to understand inventory management?	"Inventories are company assets that are intended for use in the production of goods or services made for sale, are currently in the production process, or are finished products held for sale in the ordinary course of business. Inventory also includes goods or services that are on consignment (subject to return by a retailer) or in transit.
There are three types of inventory: raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. Given the significant costs and benefits associated with inventory, companies spend considerable amounts of time calculating what the optimal level of inventory should be at any given time. Because maximizing profits means minimizing inventory expenses, several inventory-control models, such as the ABC inventory classification method, the economic order quantity (EOQ) model, and just-in-time management are intended to answer the question of how much to order or produce.
Inventory management also means maintaining effective internal controls over inventory, including safeguarding the inventory from damage or theft, using purchase orders to track inventory movement, maintaining an inventory ledger, and frequently comparing physical inventory counts with recorded amounts.
Common inventory accounting methods include ""first in, first out"" (FIFO), ""last in, first out"" (LIFO), and lower of cost or market (LCM). Some industries, such as the retail industry, tailor these methods to fit their specific circumstances. Public companies must disclose their inventory accounting methods in the notes accompanying their financial statements.
Inventory management makes its biggest mark on the inventory line item of the balance sheet. That line item doesn't just reflect the cost of the inventory; it also reflects costs directly or indirectly incurred in readying an item for sale, including not only the purchase price of that item but the freight, receiving, unpacking, inspecting, storage, maintenance, insurance, taxes, and other costs associated with it.
Inventory management is a key component of cost of goods sold and thus is a key driver of profit, total assets, and tax liability. Many financial ratios, such as inventory turnover, incorporate inventory values to measure certain aspects of the health of a business. For these reasons, and because changes in commodity and other materials prices affect the value of a company?õ????s inventory, inventory management is important.
Inventory management is also a key part of managing a company's supply chain. Buy too much stuff, and a company can end up paying more for warehousing, insurance, shipping, and other services related to obtaining and maintaining inventory. All of these affect the bottom line. Finding the best way to buy, store and move inventory can make the difference between profits and losses for many companies.
Because there are several ways to account for inventory and because some industries require more inventory than others, comparison of inventory management is generally most meaningful among companies within the same industry using the same inventory accounting methods. The definition of a ""good"" or ""bad"" inventory management should be made within this context.
Thanks. Have a Good Day.

I want to do BDes in Fashion designing from NIFT. As I am a guy will I face any difficulties in that specific field?	"This is a very interesting question. I don?õ????t understand why there is still taboo about guys studying in NIFT or wanting to become a fashion designer.
So to answer your question
yes you will face difficulties but not because you are a guy. Fashion Designing is a very competitive field and you really need to work very hard to become a successful designer. Although, there are less guys in NIFT compared to girls. Guys do take designing as a career and most of the guys in NIFT are really good at what they do! It?õ????s a very brave decision for a guy to study in NIFT because of this mentality that only girls can be designers which is false as design is all about creativity. You will create wonders if you are creative irrespective of your gender. You will realize how successful guys are in this field if you see the top most Fashion Designers in India like Sabhyasachi Mukherjee , Prabal Gurung , Manish Arora , JJ Valaya , Rajesh Pratap Singh and many more. They all have pursued B.DES in Fashion Design from NIFT and are currently big names in fashion industry. The best thing about NIFT guys is they are following their passion instead of following the herd. So if you have what it takes to be a good designer your gender does not matter! All that matters is your passion for Fashion. I hope this helps.
All the best!

What is your reason for not believing in God?		
Is Muhammad and all other prophets still alive in their graves?	"Rational arguments, the Quranic verses and prophetic traditions clearly indicate that man is not perished with death. In fact, man's spirit which is an independent entity constitutes his identity. The Quran ascribes accidents and flaws to the body only not to the spirit. The interesting thing is that in the Holy Qur'an ""dying"" is mentioned fourteen times with the word
As for the question about the situation of the spirit after death, it is also a question whose answer should be found from the Quranic verses as well as traditions. In this regard the Holy Quran says: ""And behind them is a barrier [partition] until the day [of resurrection] when they are raised.""
?õ????
The people of
In another traditions narrated from Imam Sadiq (a.s), he has been quoted as having said: ""The spirits of the believers are lodged in Paradise and the spirits of the unbelievers are lodged in Hell Fire.""
It has also been reported from the Imam that the spirits of Mustaz'afeen (the third group) are stored in their graves where the sweet fragrance of Paradise reach them.
Of course, it has been said in other traditions also that the spirits of believers go to Wadi al-Salam
As for the spirits of the
Based on the above, it can be said that the conditions of the spirits depends on their degrees and ranks after death. One who is strongly attached to this world, it will take him a long time to believe death and forget the world and its attractions. And he who is from the middle group, goes to a deep sleep never seeing any dream to be either tormented or pleased with it. He will not have any special feeling of the intermediate life. As for the perfect believers, since they have strengthened their spirits and prepared themselves for the hereafter, they can also establish relations with the spirits of other believers in that abode. Thus, they can get news of their friends and ask after their health in the material world. They become happy when they see that their friends are in good health. They pray for those who live in the world. Therefore, only those who are perfect believers can have the opportunity to meet other believers and ask after their health.
Imam Sadiq (a.s) says: When a human being enters the grave and Barzakh, the people of Barzakh rush to see him. They console him for a while until he comes to his senses because he has just passed the horrors, the tiring moments of the grave, its questioning and squeezing etc. Then they approach him and ask him about the lives and conditions of the friends. If he says that they are still in the world, they become hopeful that they might see him later. And if he says that they had died long time ago, they will say ""He has fallen."" That is to say, he is suffering from divine punishment, otherwise he would have been brought to us.""
It has been narrated from Ishaq bin Ammar in Al-Kafi that he said, ""I asked Imam Kazem (a.s) whether a dead person would meet his family. Imam Kazem replied: ""Yes."" Then I asked: ""How often does he meet them?"" Imam Kazem replied: ""Depending on his divine position, he may meet them once every week, once every month or once every year...""
Above these group of people, there are the divine saints whose spirits become stronger after death and after shaking off the material body. Their activities increase because the worldly obstructions like Taqiyah (practicing the faith in concealment), suffocation and the likes are no longer there. This group of people comes to the death bed of dying people making their deaths easier. They become their friends in the grave and deliver them from loneliness and horror. Then after preliminary procedures, he is taken to his friends to join them. For this reason, this group of people does not need to be informed by other spirits about people living on earth because they have full knowledge of the world and the intermediate realm. They are not negligent of the conditions of the believers especially those who are in communication with them, serve them and seek means of nearness through them.

"For me, the ?õ????stigma?õ???? associated with going to the hospital and sitting there receiving chemotherapy and everyone?õ????s shock reaction was worse than the actual drug. I guess I was lucky that I didn?õ????t get very sick. The worst side effect was my brain was fried. I couldn?õ????t remember if I?õ????d turned the iron off or if I?õ????d paid the phone bill or people?õ????s names. The second worst side effect was the dark thoughts, anxiety and confusion. The other bad side effects were thinning hair and a weird taste in my mouth.
What helped me the most through chemotherapy was the vitamins and alternative therapies. I take very good quality multi vitamins, anti oxidants, vitamins C,D,E, fish oil, Q10 and tumeric. I try to eat all organic food and have eliminated sugar. I have regular chakra punctures and try to reduce stress. I believe the vitamins and healthy diet are why I survived chemotherapy so well. I didn?õ????t loose all of my hair and I worked every day except treatment days. I went straight back to work the following day. Some people didn?õ????t even know I was going through chemotherapy.
I also didn?õ????t stop doing anything - I stilled walked my child into school, did the grocery shopping and worked in retail full time. I didn?õ????t get sick once even though my immune system was low. Again I contribute this to the vitamins.
Chemotherapy has made me realise just how short life is. I now take every opportunity I get. I used to think ?õ????next time?õ????, now I just do it. I have stepped outside my comfort zone so many times since completing chemo. I?õ????ve travelled overseas by myself, completed obstacle races, raced motorbikes, gone to concerts I wouldn?õ????t normally go to. When other girls are worried about their hair getting wet, I bomb dive into the pool. I no longer worry about what people think.

Not well known as of now, but worth spreading the news.
You add a yellow ribbon to your dog if he needs privacy. Be it because you are training, sickness, fear, agression, whatever.
You can do that, and then tell the other one that, as he can see, your dog is wearing a yellow ribbon today as he is busy. But he will sure be happy tomorrow.

What ridiculous tactic have you used to appear to be studying to your parents?	"We had the Internet for the first time in 2001 at home, I was barely 12. I quickly discovered the infinite fun I could have with this amazing tool, whether it was flash games, IRC or whatever a 12 yo teenager can download with a 56k modem.
I pretended I needed to access the Internet to search for home assignments I did not even have. I always kept a Wikipedia page open on the topic I lied about.
The biggest challenge was to pretend to work while not getting caught playing a game. I first used Internet Explorer 6 and tabs did not existed back then, and had to open multiple windows. Whenever I heard my mum walking up the stairs, I had to use Alt+F4 and quit the game. I would lose all progress.
I then discovered Netscape 7 where tabs where introduced. What a game changer. I just had to Crtl+Tab and poof! I was back on Wikipedia, without leaving the game. My parents - not really tech-savvy - wouldn?õ????t understand that the tab was actually another window and moreover a game, actually.
Once they caught my simple trick, I discovered Opera and used this ridiculously long shortcut, Ctrl + Alt + Shift + H that actually completely hides the browser, just as an icon just besides the time on the bottom right of your desktop. They never got this one and used it until I could afford to pay my first laptop.
I ended up learning a lot with all those fake assignments though!

What kind of city is Lucknow? How is it?	"Indian Panorama is one of the five journeys of the Maharajas?õ???? Express, an Indian luxury train, which features Lucknow as one of its destinations. Here is a lowdown giving-out some interesting information about Lucknow ?õ???? The City of Tehzeeb.
Now we all know how the age-old adage 'Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain' came into existence. For a survey, done by electronics major LG and market research company IMRB International, has revealed that Lucknow is the second happiest city in the country, only after Chandigarh. Delhi follows at third place, while Chennai and Bengaluru are placed fourth and fifth respectively. So what is it that makes Lucknow such a happy place to live in?
It's famously said that the soul of a city is in its people. And if the people are warm and happy-go-lucky, can the city be far behind? ""It's the people of the city who carry their culture forward. Lucknow is regarded as such a culturally-rich city and all the credit for it goes to the warm and helpful people here. If someone is stuck on the road, people come forward and help. I myself have faced many such experiences.
Lucknow is also one of the most peace-loving cities in the country. Jawaharlal Nehru acknowledged it at the time of Independence that Lucknow was the only city which didn't face any communal rioting. And that record is maintained till date.
The way to a happy heart is through the stomach. I'm a big, big foodie, and feel so much pride in boasting about Lucknow's food to my friends outside the city. Tundey kebabs, rasmalai, chaat -- my day isn't complete till I visit one of the famous outlets for a bit. The local food here has played a huge role in making me attached to the city.
Lucknow is extremely popular for Chikan and Lucknavi Zardozi. Both of these are two kinds of stylish and delicate Indian embroideries. The export of these rich materials, forms a significant part of the revenue to the city. There is a huge demand of both these handcrafted embroideries, not only in India but in overseas markets as well.
Lucknow boasts of being home to various tourist attractions. Roomi gate, Bada Imambada, Shah Mina Shah, Tare Wali Kothi, Dilkusha, Khursheed Manzil, Satkhanda, Shahi Baoli, Nadan Mahal, Banarsi Bagh, Chattar Manzil are some of well-known attractions for tourists.
Little quirks come together to make the city a happier place to live in. Lucknow is spared the pressures of deadlines since the corporate culture hasn't completely taken over, and that gives the people the luxury to work with their own pace.

Is there a number which is equal to it's cube but not equal to it's square?	"Let's proceed towards the answer to this question step by step.
Eg:- (-2)^3= -2 *-2 *-2= -8
(-2)^2= 4
Since, negative sign can never be associated with 0.
Only option left is -1. Lets test if -1 is correct or not.
(-1)^3= -1*-1*-1= -1 i.e the number itself.
(-1)^2=-1*-1=1 which isn't equal to -1.

Has a person ever accidentally sworn or cursed at a Chinese because of a wrong tone?	"When i was in high school , I had a friend called Andrew.
Andrew was of Chinese-Portuguese descent. Most of the time, he speaks in English with his friends and family and occasionally a little broken Mandarin with his Chinese friends.
One day, we were having a computer class in the computer lab and one of the computers that my Chinese classmate, M, were using just couldn?õ????t be switched on for some reasons.
M: ?õ????What should I do? The computer is broken.?õ????
Andrew: ?õ????Go ?õ????diao?õ???? the teacher!?õ????
If you don?õ????t already know, ?õ????diao?õ???? (?õ?????ù?Ò???õ????), means F*uck in mandarin.
Lee: ?õ???? What??? Why???õ???ù
Andrew: ?õ????Well, what else should you do? ?õ????Diao?õ???? him and he will solve it!?õ????
After a few seconds of confusion, we got our head around what Andrew was trying to say.
Poor boy wanted to say ?õ????TELL?õ???? but then he mixed up both the english and mandarin pronunciations!
Fortunately, no teacher was ?õ????diao?õ????-ed that day.

Is it true that al-Qaeda thought about hitting atomic reactors in the US prior to 9/11 but deemed it too extreme?

Why are Americans so sure about the safety of having guns?	"Let me provide you with details of a shocking event?õ????
On January 17th, 2017, a man entered a movie theater showing a child/teen movie (?õ????Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?õ???ù). He was in company with his friend and his 9 year old son. The theater was packed with children, teens and adults.
The man was armed with a .45 caliber pistol and two dozen rounds of ammunition.

And private citizens, lacking qualified immunity if they are forced to use their guns, usually train more and shoot
The man in question above has concealed carry permits issued by two different states and received training at his expense and time to acquire them. A third permit is pending. Together, these permits are legally recognized across the majority of the United States. There was nothing nefarious or terrifying in his carry of a concealed firearm in a public space.
Your fears are exactly that:

What is the best habits to do lifetime?	"I used to find it hard to fall asleep until I began visualizing how I wanted the next day to go. Instead of my mind wandering from topic to topic, focusing on what ?õ????might?õ???ù go wrong, I started focusing on what ?õ????would?õ???ù go
One of the big reasons why you?õ????re not reaching your goals is likely to do with how much you have on your plate, professionally
I now get all of my important work done before everyone else is even awake?õ????you would not believe the difference this makes! There?õ????s no better feeling than knowing no matter what happens for the rest of the day, you?õ????ve accomplished what you set out to. Bring on the interruptions and distractions; you?õ????ll be armed and ready!
Wake up and do the same things in the same order before you start your day: have a glass of water, exercise, read, etc. Do things that you normally don?õ????t have time for that make you happy. Easing into your day instead of rushing to get started not only depletes your stress level significantly, but puts you in a proactive frame of mind for the remainder of the day.
Having a glass of water first thing in the morning helps rid your body of toxins that have been stored overnight. Not only does it aid your digestive tract, it also boosts your metabolism, helping you feel energized sooner.
Only 2% of the world?õ????s population can successfully multitask. The rest of us posers are serial-tasking: flitting from one task to another, nudging ourselves forward with each instead of focusing on one at a time. I broke this habit by choosing one item on my to-do list, then hiding it in a drawer until I was done. It?õ????s a tough habit to break, but once you do your mind feels clearer, you feel less restless, and the quality of your work skyrockets across the board.
External clutter leads to mental clutter. Do a clean sweep of your home and get rid of everything you no longer use or have never used. By the end of my own clean sweep last year, it looked like I?õ????d been robbed! There?õ????s no better feeling than knowing you actually need and use everything you?õ????re surrounded by. Bonus: you also save time by not having as much to clean!
It?õ????s too easy to get sucked into an online world of status updates, memes, list posts, and videos. Before you know it, over half your day is gone and you have nothing to show for it. This is especially difficult for those of us who work on the Internet. One of the best daily habits I?õ????ve established is not checking my e-mail or social media accounts first thing in the morning. Create specific windows of time for your online tasks. It?õ????s okay to check your e-mail periodically in case you receive urgent requests from your boss or co-workers, but if you check and there aren?õ????t any, abort and get back to your day.
Your evening routine is just as important as your morning routine, as it prepares your body for a solid night?õ????s sleep. Create a relaxing routine that starts about an hour before you go to bed, and use it as your body?õ????s ?õ????signal?õ???ù that it?õ????s time to go to sleep.
That?õ????s it
Lead a happy life;):):)

Is it okay for a normal person to not leave his house for about a week or so with everything necessary provided such as food and stuff?	"?õ????Normal?õ???ù is not a terribly useful concept where human beings are concerned.
Here?õ????s a good guideline for whether a behavior, or any experience, is cause for concern. Does it harm another person? Does it harm the person exhibiting the behavior? Is it a problem for their relationships? Is it a problem for their livelihood? If this time away is based in fear or anxiety or is painful or causes problems for a person?õ????t life or livelihood or relationships, then they might want to consider seeing a counselor or therapist to exlore the roots of the behavior or get help dealing with it.
But if someone can safely take a week away from all the other spheres of life, why not do it?

Do governments around the world take their cue from the US in formulating their legislation?

What are the best small classes for freshmen at the University of Southern Maine?	"Most freshman courses are lectures, with between 30 - 50+ students. Compared to many other universities, this is likely smaller than the average. Most of my friends at other public universities regularly were in freshman lectures with 100+ students. That said, this is probably not going to fit your definition of ?õ????small?õ???ù. Where you will find small, freshman level courses is in departments with limited enrollment. My freshman engineering courses regularly had 20?õ????25 students in them. Of course, you will likely need to be pursuing a degree in one of these departments to be able to take the course. If you are not pursuing a degree in these departments, you will probably not be able to benefit from these courses, as they will likely not meet any of the requirements for the degree you are enrolled in.
There is a reason that small freshman level courses are the size that they are. Not many people benefit from taking them.

Is sugar bad for cats?	"Cats actually do not have the ability to taste sugar. As you may, or may not, know, there are different areas on your tongue that are in control of different tastes: sweet, sour, etc. Cats do not have the taste buds to detect sugar. This does not mean, however, that they will not eat something sweet, because there may very well be something else that attracts them to that food.
Sugar, itself, is not directly harmful to cats, in moderation, of course, although I do not know if a cat would eat straight sugar. (honestly, I?õ????ve never tried it). But other foods with sugar in it (like chocolate) are harmful to cats and should be avoided.
Plus the fact that cats, like humans, can get diseases like diabetes where sugar can be a true detriment to their health, so I would not suggest giving sugar to your cat.

"What's a better city to live and work in, Arlington, Texas or Charlotte, North Carolina?"	"I?õ????m a Texan that has called Charlotte home for the last two years after living in Dallas and Austin for nearly 15 years. Charlotte has certainly grown on me and I can say that I really enjoy living here. However, I am looking forward to going back to the Lone Star state in the near future for a couple of reasons. Here?õ????s a quick, surface-level, and unintentionally biased breakdown of some differences between the two.
Charlotte seems to be split between two groups - one that wants the city to grow and invest in infrastructure, research, etc. and one that wants the city to remain exactly as it is. It?õ????s an interesting contrast that leads to tension, especially around housing and education. I would argue that Charlotte is the least progressive place I?õ????ve lived. Additionally, the infrastructure was not built to support the current population level and it gets worse every month. There are projects underway to help alleviate the issue, but it?õ????s too little too late. Less important though a complaint of mine - the speed limits are ridiculously slow. Toll roads in Texas post speed limits of 75?õ????85 MPH, so 55 seems like a crawl.
I might be hard on Charlotte, but both places really do have a lot to offer. Good luck!

What are some criticisms of mainstream monetary policy from the perspective of modern monetary theory?	"Before I answer the main point of this question I will first clarify what I take ?õ????mainstream monetary policy?õ???ù to mean. Mainstream monetary policy is of course part of mainstream economics and I am going to define mainstream economics as being on the following philosophical foundations:
This will do as a basis for definition, although of course it could be expanded further. Now we need to think about MMT. What follows is my own understanding rather than any textbook definition.
MMT is an analysis of the structure of the economic system built from the bottom up by analysing what entities are in place within a modern economy and how they interact on a daily basis. These interactions can be verified back to the fundamental entries within the record keeping systems of the entities involved. Built up from these foundations MMT tends to leave a person with the following broad conclusions:
So from these points we can see that MMT would criticise mainstream monetary theory as being:
I could go on but that probably says enough to get the crux of the difference in perspectives.

The above are the only ways to cross the border on an Interstate Highway; there are also lots of US Highways and (pairs of) State Highways that cross.
Note that, unlike some other states with a shared border, GA and FL generally do not cooperate on state highway numbers. For example, one can cross from Oregon to Nevada on OR-140 which becomes NV-140 near the northwest corner of Nevada.

Why does pain feel real in a dream?	"Oh boy, another great question, the answer about which I can only speculate.
First, the most straightforward answer is that when we feel pain, it is 'real'. That is, pain is a feeling and we only know that it is actually present if we feel it. And by definition, if we feel it, it's real!
Now the complicated answer. The sensation of pain is largely generated in the brain. My understanding is that there are pain receptors in the skin and in many parts of the body. However when they send a signal to the brain it is the brain that generates the sensation of pain. This pain sensation can be blocked in various ways, so that if a pain receptor is stimulated, what should cause pain does not.
And interestingly, although I have not experienced this, the perception of pain can even be blocked or diminished using hypnosis. Further evidence of the brain's role in producing pain is the observation that people who have had a limb amputated can sometimes feel sensations that appear to be coming from that limb. I believe it's called 'phantom limb syndrome'.
Because of the nature of pain sensations, pain disorders become a possibility. That is to say that one can feel pain even though a thorough search can reveal no physical cause for the pain. A person can have back pain for years even though physical injuries to the body heal within six weeks or so. (Some parts of the body are said never to heal, for instance damaged nerves or brain cells. Even that however has come into question.)
The brain can even learn to perceive ordinary physical sensations as painful!
All of this means that it's entirely possible that pain can be felt in a dream without a physical source, and as I said previously pain is real when it's felt.
That being said, it is not uncommon for the body to generate a dream around pain that does have a physical source, such as a cramped leg, an insect bite, chest pain, muscle spasms, etc.
So a dream about pain could have a physical source and it could have a nonphysical source, and in both cases the pain is real.
So is that as clear as mud?
The dreamer holds the keys to unlocking the mystery of the dream. Sweet pain-free dreams.

Who really invented radio?	"There were many radio visionaries that proved the concept of radio waves. In 1894, the Indian physicist, Jagadish Chandra Bose, demonstrated radio waves by igniting gunpowder and ringing bell at a distance using electromagnetic waves.
Nikola Tesla first demonstrated to the public in 1898, a remotely controlled model boat at New York City's old Madison Square Garden.
Marconi gets credit for the invention of radio, but he was actually working on the idea of ""wireless telegraphy,"" the transmission of telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the electric telegraph. In 1901, the signal that Marconi sent across the Atlantic Ocean was a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter S.
But it was Reginald Fessenden who broadcast to ships at sea the first music and voice program which included himself playing the violin and reading from the Bible, on Christmas Eve 1906. Sailors who typically were listening for dots and dashes heard ""O Holy Night"" instead.
Reginald Fessenden is not as well-known as his contemporary inventors such as Edison, Marconi, and Tesla. As I researched the question of ""who invented radio"" it become clear that in the end it was the work of Fessenden that established radio as one of the most powerful communication tools in history.
Supporters of Nikola Tesla point to the 1943 ruling by the US Supreme Court as ""proof"" that Tesla should be called the father of radio because Marconi lost the patents to radio. As far as the decision proclaiming Nikola Tesla the inventor of radio, the following two sentences are from the remarks of Mr. Chief Justice Stone in delivering the opinion of the Court are pretty clear.

Why is everything spherical in outer space?	"Your question is partially correct, because we do have objects that are not spherical, they have random shapes like asteroids, comets and small moons. Now the question arises, why some are spherical and some are not. The reason behind them is mass and size of the object. There is a threshold value for mass after which all the object will be spherical in shape and below that value they can have random shapes.
When we increase the mass of an object, the gravitation pull at the surface, due to the rest of the object also increases. And after certain threshold value the gravitational pull become so much dominating that it crushes the outer surface and mould it into a spherical shape. Now why spherical only and not cuboidal or any other shape. The answer of this question lies in the nature of the gravitational field, we know that gravitational field are radial in nature so, they tend to pull all the debris toward its center of gravity, and the only shape that we can get out of this, is a sphere.
Now you must be thinking by now that, earth is not perfect spherical neither is Jupiter than what is the reason behind it. It is because of their spin about the axis which makes it look a little bulgy at the equator.

Is there any evidence that would stand up in a court of law proving the existence of the Christian God?	"Remember, Every Belief System is based on Something Unproven. Which highlights the fact that Evolution is has much a religion as anything else.
But if you want evidence in the Court of Law? This makes me smile to tell you this but the whole Judicial system is based on the Belief in YHWH/God. You?õ????re choosing to focus what can be proving in the court of Law while bypassing the fact that the Court of Law itself is based on the existence of YHWH/God. Have you never asked yourself why certain things have been put in place? The use of the Bible, which indeed they are trying to eradicate. The sermons/ promises professed before the accused, witness or victim gives his/her testimony. And many more?õ????without sounding too forceful since that is not the intent, you might be fighting a losing battle.
But whether you?õ????re coming from a religious point of view, believing in another deity/god, and asking questions on YHWH, the God of the Bible, or it?õ????s from a evolutionist/atheistic point of view or just out of pure curiosity(if it is then we are like-minded), there is proof, upon proof upon proof. But without trying to sound to bias, I would invite you to, since you ask of the Existence of the God of the Bible to take The Bible itself as a base and research from it in real life all that comes from it, whether its on a Biblical, Non-Biblical, geographical, archaeological, historical standpoint. But from a spiritual standpoint, that alone is going to have to be between You & HIM alone, since you are requesting his presence. Nothing is being forced on you as we have all been giving the freewill of choice, but if you truly desire to know the full extent of it all(the evidence), even though you've never done it before, it might be a good time when/if the time is right to ask HIM to reveal himself to you(Prayer).

Why do people forget that Donald Trump is a successful businessman?	"There is a difference between a successful businessman and a salesman who
Trump is a brand. The brand is the *appearance* of a top-notch, highest quality goods and services: ties, hotel rooms, steaks, wine, real estate, classes from hand-picked educators at a University, and many more. If you can afford the cost, you can put Trump?õ????s name on your product. Pay enough, and he?õ????ll sit on camera and speak earnestly, lobbing sweet promises and superlatives like pixie dust.
The successful businesspeople of the world generally do not appear in painful infomercials, making inane claims of quality that should trigger warning lights for any informed consumer.
Of the business ventures credited to Trump, many are not his companies at all; they?õ????re merely licensing agreements. He has buildings bearing his name, but some of those buildings were not built or maintained by him or his companies; the people who built the building licensed his name for its supposed cachet. You know, like Robin Leach used to, being attached to the ?õ????Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous?õ???ù property.
The fact that these license agreements have frequently ended in dismal failure, as William Murphy has already amply demonstrated, is proof that Trump doesn?õ????t know nearly as much as he claims to know about winning propositions. He?õ????s just trying to sell a product, the same as a car salesman:
?õ????You won?õ????t believe how smooth she drives. This is the greatest car on the lot, and I?õ????m serious. If I needed a car, this would be the car I?õ????d be driving right now, I?õ????m telling you, out of all the rest of them, this is the car I?õ????d want. Look, this is what the service guys are all telling me, they?õ????re all saying: don?õ????t sell that car, we want it. Well, I say, ?õ????Let?õ????s make your life great again. Let?õ????s put you behind the wheel of this car.?õ?????õ???ù
So?õ????this guy who sells the image of a master businessman, a successful multibillionaire with discriminating tastes for the finest things in life?õ????he now wants us to think of him as having Presidential-quality abilities. Since he has no political record for us to examine, no records of charitable donations so that we can see if he?õ????s really as charitable as his puffery makes it sound, the single best way to tell how successful he is as a businessman is to look at his income taxes.
He has gone through PAINSTAKING effort NOT to let people see his income tax returns ?õ???? and despite his saying definitively that he would!
What?õ????s even more damning is that he said, in a widely-circulated legal deposition, that his net worth fluctuates depending on his mood.

What is the formula of sin(A-B)?	"sin(A ?õ???? B) = sin A cos B ?õ???? cos A sin B
A very similar construction finds the formula for the cosine of an angle made with two angles added together.
Using the same construction (1), notice that the adjacent side is the full base line (for cos A), with part of it subtracted at the right. Each part must use the same denominator, the hypotenuse of the (A + B) triangle.
The full base line, divided by the dividing line between angles A and E, is cos A (2). This dividing line, divided by the hypotenuse of (A + B) triangle, is cos B (3). So, the full base line divided by the hypotenuse is the product cos A cos B (4).
Now, for the little part that has to be subtracted. The shaded part (5) represents sin A, which multiplied by the shaded part (6) is sin E, which produces the other piece you need (7). The subtraction produces cos(A + B) (8) so that the formula we need is:
A complete geometric derivation of the formula for tan(A + B) is complicated. An easy way is to derive it from the two formulas that you have already done. In any angle, the tangent is equal to the sine divided by the cosine. Using that fact, tan(A + B) = sin(A + B)/cos(A + B). In a way that does it, but you can expand that to:
Show the ratios for sine, cosine, and tangent by substituting into the sum formula, then reducing the result to its simplest form, before evaluating the surds. After making the basic substitutions in each case, the rough work is in shading - to show how the result is reduced to the simplest form for evaluation.
If you use your pocket calculator for evaluation, it will probably make no difference whether you simplify the expressions first or just plow through it! Everything depends on the calculator: some do make a difference, some don't!
So far, ratios of acute angles (between 0 and 90 degrees) have been considered. Other triangles with obtuse angles (over 90 degrees) might go over 180 degrees in later problems. To simplify classification of angles according to size, they are divided into quadrants.
A
Drawing in lines to represent the quadrant boundaries, with 0 or 360 horizontal to the right, 90 vertical up, 180 horizontal to the left, and 270 vertical down. Now, use this method for plotting graphs.
Progressively larger angles are defined by a rotating vector, starting from zero and rotating counterclockwise. Horizontal elements are x: positive to the right, negative to the left. Vertical elements are y. positive up, negative down. The rotating vector is r. So, the sine of an angle is y/r, the cosine x/r, and the tangent y/x. The vector r is always positive. So, the sign of the ratios can be figures for the various quadrants.
Here, the signs of the three ratios have been tabulated for the four quadrants. Also how the equivalent angle in the first quadrant ""switches"" as the vector passes from one quadrant to the next. In the first quadrant, the sides were defined in the ratios for sine, cosine, and tangent. As you move into bigger angles in the remaining quadrants, the opposite side is always the vertical (y). What was called the adjacent is always the horizontal (x). The hypotenuse is always the rotating vector (r). You will begin to see a pattern to the way these trigonometric ratios for angles vary.
Now, you have two ways to obtain formulas for difference angles. First, use a geometric construction, such as the one that was used for sum angles, reversing it so that (A - B) is the angle B subtracted from the angle A.
In reasoning similar to that which was used for the sum angles, presented here somewhat abbreviated, are the sine and cosine formulas:
The second method of finding the formula for difference angles uses the sum formula already obtained, but makes B negative. From our investigation of the signs for various quadrants, negative angles from the 1 st quadrant will be in the 4th quadrant. Making this substitution produces the same results that arrived geometrically in the previous section.
Finding the tangent formula follows the same method, either going through substitution into the sine and cosine formulas, or more directly, by making tan(-B) = - tan B. Either way you get:
You can deduce a few more ratios with the sum and difference formulas. You already did ratios for 75 degrees. Now, do those for 15 degrees. These formulas give ratios for angles at 15-degree intervals through the four quadrants. Plotting them out for the full 360 degrees, you can see how the three ratios change as the vector sweeps through the four quadrants.
Both the sine and cosine ""wave"" up and down between +1 and -1. Notice that the ""waves"" are displaced by 90 degrees, one from the other. This fact becomes important later.
The tangent starts out like the sine curve, but quickly it sweeps up to reach infinity at 90 degrees. Going ""offscale"" in the positive direction, it ""comes on"" from the negative direction on the other side of 90 degrees. Going through the 180-degree point, the tangent curve duplicates what it does going through 0 or 360 (whichever you view it as). At 270 degrees, it repeats what it did at 90 degrees.
A formula can often be simplified, as was found by deriving the tangent formulas from the sine and cosine formulas, and changing it from terms using one ratio to terms using another ratio. In doing this, the Pythagorean theorem, expressed in trigonometry ratios, is very handy.
Assume that a right triangle has a hypotenuse of 1 unit long. Then one of the other sides will have a length of sin A and the other of cos A. From that, the Pythagorean theorem shows that: cos
2
A + sin
2
A = 1. This statement is always true, for any value of A.
A little thing here about the way it's written. Cos
2
A means (cos A)
2
. If you wrote it cos A
2
, the equation would mean something else. A is a number in some angular notation that represents an angle. A
2
would be the same number squared. Its value would depend on the angular notation used, so it's not a good term to use. What is meant is the angle's sine or cosine squared, not the angle itself.
The Pythagoras formula can be transposed. For instance, two other forms are:
2
A = 1 - sin
2
A, and sin
2
= 1 - cos
2
A.
The sum formulas, along with the Pythagorean theorem, are used for angles that are 2, 3, or a greater exact multiple of any original angle. Here, give formulas for 2A and 3A. The same method is pursued further in Parts 3 and 4 of this book.
The sum formula works whether both angles are the same or different: sin(A + B) or sin(A + A). However, sin(A + A) is really sin 2A. So, sin 2A is sin A cos A + cos A sin A. They are both the same product, in opposite order, so this statement can be simplified to sin 2A = 2 sin A cos A.
Similarly, cos 2A = cos A cos A - sin A sin A, which also can be written: cos 2A = cos
2
A - sin
2
A. Using the Pythagorean theorem, change that to: cos 2A = 2cos
2
A - 1. Finally, tan 2A = 2 tan A/[1 - tan
2
A].
Now, the triple angle (3A) is used just to show how further multiples are obtained. Basically, it's as simple as writing 3A = 2A + A and reapplying the sum formulas. But then, to get the resulting formula in workable form, you need to substitute for the 2A part to get everything into terms of ratios for the simple angle A.
Work your way through the three derivations shown here. You can see that it will get more complicated for 4 A and more (in Parts 3 and 4 of this book).

"Should I give up my seat to an elderly or disabled person on public transport, or might this offend them?"	"Here?õ????s a little trick that can ease awkward social situations: they should be small.
Offering someone a seat doesn?õ????t need to be a grand sweeping gesture. It doesn?õ????t even need to be spoken. You catch their eye, and you use body language to say, ?õ????I?õ????m getting up, would you like to sit down??õ???ù It?õ????s a bit hard to describe, but it?õ????s a fairly natural maneuver: you shift your weight forward, and twist slightly in a direction that hints that you?õ????re getting out of their way. Basically, imagine that you already were getting out of the seat so they could sit there.
It?õ????s accompanied by a facial expression, a quizzical eyebrow-raise and a bit of a smile. And with eye contact, looking for a reply.
That reply can also be small: a big thank-you smile, or a polite no-thanks (often, a very small head shake, or pressing the lips together, or a hand out hinting at a ?õ????stop?õ???ù gesture).
That?õ????s a lot of words to describe it, but the action is extremely small, and it takes a moment. If they accept, you do it. If they say don?õ????t, it only took a moment, and you can both pretend it didn?õ????t happen. And an instant later, you will have both forgotten.
There?õ????s no time for them to be offended. A verbal conversation could potentially open an opportunity for them to say that they were offended, but without it nobody even took the time to think. They didn?õ????t have to take the effort to recognize your voice, parse you in a noisy subway, or formulate a reply to the specifics of what you just said.
Life is full of these momentary interactions. You?õ????re already doing them a hundred times a day without realizing. There?õ????s an enormous amount of politeness that comes from pretending other people don?õ????t exist, despite having to coordinate your actions with them. We deliberately push them below our conscious radar, and life moves on just fine.
If they were somehow the kind of person who received that offer many times a day, it would be tiresome to turn it down verbally each time.* That might indeed get them offended; it?õ????s not your fault that their appearance misleads you into thinking they might require your seat, but the cumulative effect is draining. But if you make the gesture very small, it?õ????s a smaller effect, and it doesn?õ????t accumulate as much. It falls below the conscious level.
I?õ????m not saying you shouldn?õ????t do it verbally, if that?õ????s your style. Verbal communication can be less ambiguous, and politeness interactions are always better when they?õ????re clear. But you can take advantage of interactions that are even smaller than words. They can be plenty clear; in context, they can even be clearer.
Don?õ????t worry yourself overmuch about the kind of people who are too easily offended. Yes, they exist, but they?õ????re rarer than you might be led to think, especially In Real Life. (The Internet tends to encourage such people, and they tend to be louder and more memorable than they need to be.) The offer of a seat is a near-universal politeness:
* Note that this is how microaggressions work. The aggressor may genuinely not feel like complimenting you on your appearance was offensive, but it?õ????s an incursion on you, in precisely the kind of situation where we use these politeness rules to create psychological space where there isn?õ????t any physical space. Each individual one isn?õ????t large, but collectively they add up to a very, very big thing.

The preamble of the constitution, Fundamental Rights, Directive Principle of State Policy speak about socioeconomic justice very precisely. Hence, it cannot be said as an unfulfilled dream of India. There are odds, which show the breach of justice. But 70% of the Indian population is availing it for their convenience.

Does the universe spin like a Frisbee or stand still (the Milky Way Galaxy spins)?	"Using a Machian argument, if the Universe spun up, then a bucket of water should always have a vortex formed in, as if the bucket were spinning.
Consider also, that if the Universe were spinning, then more and more distant objects would be exceeding c, except for those along the axis of rotation. Yet there are no objects that are less redshifted at similar distance.
So the Universe is (or might be) the source of all inertia, so defines both ?õ????rest?õ???ù (the frame of maximal aging), and ?õ????no rotation?õ???ù.

Is QNET a scam? Explain with your experience.	"It's and absolute scam. It's a pyramid scheme, which is an unsustainable business model. Those fools who have already enrolled would act as if they are earning huge through this, just to entice and lure. Once in, you will figure out that you have been made a scape goat and will shamelessly lure people so as to recover the huge sum you paid. Besides losing money, you will eventually lose respect, self-esteem, confidence, become depressed and looked upon as a joker.
Here is the Facebook post I made after a few such encounters:
While I m casually browsing through books at Landmark or Crossword or while waiting for the bus, some guy would smile at me and start a conversation. He would flatter me and finally with the statement, ""let's keep in touch"", would ask for my mobile no. I m flattered and would end up sharing my mobile no.
A few days later, I would get a phone call from this guy whom I met at the bookstore or bus stop. Ha ha ha... All these jokers who called me would exchange pleasantries and then make the next statement ""We are actually working on a wonderful business alongside a few people from IIT/IIM and are looking for likeminded people to expand. I think you have the potential and would be a great fit, besides you can make big bucks in a short while."" When I ask, could you please explain in detail, the reply would be ""It's difficult to explain it on phone. I ll arrange for a detailed session where you can get all your queries answered""
By mistake I went one such session. The hall or the house where these sessions would be filled with people who had already fallen into the trap along with the newly found scapegoats they would have brought in. And those who had already fallen into the trap of MLM, though desperate inside to sign the next scapegoat would act as if they have made millions. Then, a guy would come on stage with an artificial enthusiasm and shoot out questions like, ""What do u do on weekends? Do you think u can survive on your meagre salary? Why not explore options to earn part time, while you continue your regular job? I will show you the way to earn big bucks. You just need to spend half an hour daily or a few hours on the weekend"" By falsely hyping all this, those desperate jokers would try to brainwash and make you the next scapegoat. If you don?õ????t agree, 4-5 guys would join together, hype and put a mental pressure to sign up under them. - Do not budge under pressure.
I finally escaped from one such useless session and come back home. A few days later, this guy who is supposedly making millions would call and ask if I have thought of the so called golden opportunity. When I say, I have thought of it, but can?õ????t afford my time on these, the guy would then ask ""Well, you need not join us. But we ll give you our products, which are researched and developed (They say so) and you can get it on 20-30% discount.""Ex. The idiot who spoke to me said, ""You are in IT. You do a lot of mental tasks. You energy gets drained. And of the food you eat, only 20% of it gets absorbed and the rest is all excreted. (Not sure which scientist found this 20% absorption rate. A basic internet search says that the efficiency of protein absorbed through food is around 60-80%). So we have a product, a protein powder, which has an absorption rate of 98% and your brain's efficiency would be improved manifold"" When I enquired the price, he said just Rs. 2000/can. I told him, I eat sprouts daily and meat frequently and get more than sufficient protein from these, the guy became even more desperate. And in the final stage, he started pleading with me, requesting me to buy at least any one product of theirs, which I feel are ridiculously, overly priced.
This one is related to another ponzi scheme which used to sell gold and was subsequently banned in India. This has resurfaced as QNet or QI India. One of my colleague was telling that he is doing a business part time. I got curious and wanted to know about it. He said, they are into e-commerce, FMCG, tourism, healthcare, education, fashion and so on and that it is a big conglomerate. I asked him to explain in detail. This guy said it would take 2-3 hours and I need to meet his senior, who would be able to guide me better. I figured out that it?õ????s going to be another MLM. This guy called me multiple times and I finally agreed to meet his senior, mainly to witness the fun of someone cajoling me. I was told to come to Brigade road.
I land at the said location, only to find out that these folks operate out of coffee shops. In my case it was Starbucks. Cheap business in posh ambience...Grrrr....It's a long shameless story
1. All these folks who called me started their conversation like ""We are actually working on a wonderful business opportunity alongside a few people from IIT/IIM and are looking for partners to expand. I think you have the potential and would be a great fit, besides you can make big bucks in a short while.""
2. I met a doctor who earns well, but somehow fell into one such trap and she too told one story, which I also heard from so many others. The story goes like this: ""A guy joined this business a few years back. He built his next level team of people. A few days later, he committed a crime and had to go to jail. Upon getting released, he finds crores of Rs in his bank balance, because the folks whom he enrolled under him have increased the network manifold and as a result his kitty got filled"" Do you want me to believe this story? Seriously!
Had I joined such a fraud/ponzi networks after getting tempted with their excessive hype, then:
1. I too would have developed a similar people pleaser, pleader attitude.
2. I too would have to artificially smile and initiate an unwelcome conversation with people at bookstores and bus stops.
3. I too would have to make follow up calls and lie with the statement ""We are actually working on a wonderful business alongside a few people from IIT/IIM ...""
4. I too would have made my friends and acquaintances run away out of the fear of them being made the next scapegoat.
5. I too would have been desperate to recover the money I had invested and finally start pleading with people shamelessly, losing all the respect people had on me.
6. Guys in sales have to talk and impress prospects. But a smart salesman doesn't act like a shamelessly desperate guy.

How could something be so stately, so defiant? How could it be so dainty? So pretty? How could it stand guard like that, so proud?

I have been living in San Francisco for over twenty years and see her almost every day. Every time she makes me feel all the things I felt the first time I laid eyes on her. When we drive over the bridge, conversation is arrested so that nothing detracts from taking in her entire architecture.
We return to The City later that day or a few days later. We drive along the highway and round the bend. She appears suddenly and never fails to take our breath away.
We say the same thing every single time: ?õ????Whoa this Bridge. This bridge never gets old.?õ???ù

Groves agreed and approved of the location, and the process of acquiring the land was fast-tracked as part of the war effort.

I have had silent calls - when the caller realized a male answered, requests for cost and availability, and several immediate disconnections. If I tried to return the call, most of the calls came from blocked (number not available) numbers, or from pay-phones (this number cannot receive incoming calls). One caller did not mask his number - when I called he asked I had an ad in the paper. I had- I sometime sell items we no longer use. I asked which ad, and he replied ?õ????adult stuff?õ???ù. ?õ????No sorry, that?õ????s not my ad?õ???ù.

What are the top ten reasons why someone should not date you?		
Do girls in India make comments about boys in public the way boy do?	"I have studied in a girl's college and I was very surprised to see girls talking dirty about boys in public. Means what they call eve teasing, there was actually Adam teasing happening. All these women who behaved suppressed, innocent otherwise were indulge in teasing and bullying of boys. There was all kind of teasing - race, height, size (yes, you read it correct) etc. While it was assumed that boy?õ????s must be feeling good about it, I could see the humiliation on boys?õ???? faces.
Why are we surprised and why this question is being asked? I have seen women in villages doing the same to village men. This question is asked because we have just assumed that men are suppressor and women are victims. I think it is a tendency whenever you are in majority you will ridicule the lesser one. As I always say crime and criminals doesn't have a gender. Stop watching things from woman's point of view, there is other point of view too .
*Many people asked if it was all girls college how come there were boys around. Here is the answer, some boys used to come to pick their sisters or girlfriends, then of course the cultural events where all colleges meet, some used to come for official work. I remember once a boy came to meet me to hand over one running trophy and he said in polite words, ?õ????Jyoti never imagined this kind of humiliation from girls and you know me I have always fought for the honour of girls.?õ???ù

Why are genuine diamonds so expensive?	"It takes lot of efforts, time and capital investment to mine a carat of diamond. After it has mined it goes to through various process thereby adding to cost of the final product. Not forgetting the diamond cartels who have artificially inflated the price of diamond. There is a monopoly of De Beers which has increased the demand of diamond due to involvement of celebrity and massive marketing. All these are factors responsible that diamonds are expensive. Many times customers end up paying extra due to lack of knowledge. Its always advised to take this precious stone by comparing the rates from different online vendors and with the help of virtual experts available at diamond forums.

Why do lawyers feel they are the God?	"Here's my experience: most of my clients are business owners and/or high net worth individuals. They know me by experience or referral. They believe they are dealing with a highly qualified expert on a topic on which they lack expertise.
Sometimes I tell a client: your idea won't work; don't waste time on that. Just about all my clients accept that accordingly. That's what they are paying me for.
Occasionally, a client (usually a newer one) wants to argue the point with me. It's a waste of time and money. The client doesn't know the legal area, and I do. To go into a technical explanation, especially of obscure tax law, is unproductive.

"What is the meaning of ""The child is not responding - Kill it"" in terms of programming?"	"That?õ????s very funny.
To know about it, first you need to understand a bit of processes and threads.
Any single instance of program being run is a process. A process can duplicate itself, and create another process , this can go on recursively, remember asexual reproduction, its pretty much the same, the new process is called the child of the current process, which is called the parent.
The child process is basically a copy of the parent, but can be used to run a different section of the program, or can execute a completely different program.
for example,
After the fork() system call is executed a new process is created which is assigned a different process ID which is considered child of the process which is currently executing.
Based on the value returned by the fork() call, you identify whether you are in the parent or the child (0 -> child, +ve -> parent -ve -> cannot create child).
Notice that after fork() the child which is created, will continue to execute in parallel to the parent.
Usually a new child is created by a parent to do some task which the parent is not interested in doing, to save time.
The parent waits for the child to do the work, with a wait() call, however at some point, if the child process is struck in something (IO/ network issues or anything else) and takes more time than intended, or is not responding, while the parent urgently needs to exit its work.
The parent can issue a kill() command that kills the child process meaning stop the child from executing further.
SIGKILL - is the famous signal to kill the child abruptly.

Why are Mexican girls taller and more light-skinned than Mexican-Americans?	"Mexicans don?õ????t all look the same, any more than Americans all look the same.

How would a pedagogic conscription work?	"It wouldn?õ????t work at all. Take a look at the following website:
There is a Venn diagram with Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge. The vast majority of people (?õ????citizens?õ???ù) don?õ????t have knowledge of any of the three kinds. But only a very few have the Pedagogical knowledge in addition to the other two. Although ?õ????Technological?õ???ù obviously applies to STEM subjects primarily, people teaching languages, arts and the softer social sciences still need to know how to use technology newer than blackboards, nowadays, too.
Plus forcing people to work in areas they don?õ????t want to doesn?õ????t work out well, ever. I am Spartacus, and all that. Never mind the fact that parents don?õ????t want unqualified adults dealing with their under-18 offspring.
What could possibly work, although this is beyond Utopian, is that everybody 12+ is tithed to work literally for the government of the people, for something between 2 and 8 hours per week on average. This might be combined with a 2 month conscript-style ?õ????bootcamp?õ???ù to be fulfilled before the 25th birthday in which the participants amonst many other things learn the fundamentals of pedagogy, including the basics of (continental-style) didactics: instruction.

Not to mention, India is a country where discrimination is rampant, based on every single thing you can imagine. I think propelling the masses towards development will do its bit to take discrimination out of the equation to some extent.
What loyalists call decisiveness, critics would call authoritarianism. Doesn?õ????t India need someone who has the political will and the capacity to guide the country through the troubled phase we are passing through? Narendra Modi certainly can be that someone.

Of one thing I am certain, I don?õ????t want a mishAAP to happen to the country like it did in Delhi. Despite the love for limelight that Kejriwal and the AAP have shown, which seems to be the one big thing they are really great at, and the connect they apparently have with people, I would not want a party with no clear ideology (anti corruption is an issue, it does not say how to run a country that?õ????s the world?õ????s largest democracy).
I am not saying Kejriwal is stupid, clearly he is not. But I would be happy to consider them at the helm of the country after a successful stint at the state level. India is a big country and politics here is never going to die. AAP will get a chance to run the country when it deserves to.
Should I talk about the third front? Suffice to say, it disintegrated faster than it formed. Also, I don?õ????t think it is wise to delve into everyone else who has suddenly expressed his/her wish, desire, ambition, whim to be the country?õ????s PM, not here at least. Midnight?õ????s summer dream, eh?
These parties have regional popularity which will fetch them the deserved votes and give them a healthy number of seats to keep the head party at the centre under leash, so to say.

That process of calming myself down has been incredibly difficult for me to learn and, frankly, I?õ????m often still terrible at it. The way I manage it now is to try to craft situations in a way that I?õ????m not going to feel emotionally vulnerable, and the way I do that is to lay my cards on the table up front ?õ???? by making a public declaration of what I expect and what is going to piss me off in any situation, I set pretty obvious guide rails for my team (and me), and then we go and evaluate whether or not those guide rails make sense or not (if they don?õ????t, we change it).

Do plants contain vacoules?	"Plant cell has a single large vacuole which occupies about 70?õ????80% of the cell?õ????s space.
The vacuoles of plant cells are multifunctional organelles that are central to cellular strategies of plant development. They share some of their basic properties with the vacuoles of algae and yeast and the lysosomes of animal cells. They are lytic compartments, function as reservoirs for ions and metabolites, including pigments, and are crucial to processes of detoxification and general cell homeostasis. They are involved in cellular responses to environmental and biotic factors that provoke stress. In the vegetative organs of the plant, they act in combination with the cell wall to generate turgor pressure, the driving force for hydraulic stiffness and growth. In seeds and specialized storage tissues, they serve as sites for storing reserve proteins and soluble carbohydrates.

Is it weird for a gay man dream about having sex with a woman with emotional attachment and intimacy at night? Am I bisexual in my subconscious?	"No, it isn't weird at all and it doesn't necessarily mean that you're bisexual.
Sometimes, I have dreams where I'm a man and I have a deep, emotional relationship with a woman. Sometimes, these dreams even get a little?õ???? well,
Do these dreams indicate that I'm actually transgender? If you take them at face value, maybe, but in the waking world, I'm 99% sure that I'm not trans.
Your dreams are, for the most part, a manifestation of your daytime thoughts and experiences. Sometimes they can reveal something you're particularly stressed about or sometimes they center around something you're excited about, but rarely do they tell you something fundamental about yourself that you didn't already know.
Maybe the day before I have these dreams, I've thought about what it would be like to be a man. Maybe these daytime thoughts weren't sexual in nature, but at night, all of the subconscious thoughts our brains are still thinking about come to play together, and most people think about sex.
So don't worry; I really don't think your dreams are trying to tell you anything about your sexuality.

"Legally, who owns the rights to a voicemail someone recorded for you to hear?"		
"How much difference does a top of the line microphone preamp make when recording music, compared to using a budget preamp?"	"The primary difference between any given pre-amp and another is what the pre-amp does or does not do to the sound, and what that means to you creatively.
A pre-amp is only as good as the character you wish to add (or not) to your recorded signal.
Recording your lo-fi garage punk masterpiece on $1000 pre-amps famed for their clarity and transparency might not give you the edge you are looking for, conversely if you are trying to record for maximum transparency at ultra high resolutions, an entry level or mid tier $300 pre-amp might not have the technical or physical ability to capture the details your are seeking. (Not to mention your mic choice and mic placement.)
It?õ????s possible to make great quality recordings with even the most basic entry level gear (and expertise), but it is much, much more difficult to get to those ?õ????professional?õ???? results.
Think it about like this: both a supercar and small family car can reach 120 kph, but the supercar is no where near straining to perform, while the family car is already nearing the peak of its performance.
Furthermore, price is not really an indicator. It?õ????s quite possible to find ( or customise) a vehicle that can keep up for a fraction of the cost of a supercar .
Here?õ????s another more convoluted metaphor for fun:
(This rest of this answer is a lightly edited copy-pasta from a previous answer on Quora, altered to match the topic of this question.)
If you have a decent entry level mic and a decent entry level pre-amp they work together like an entry level DSLR camera and its ?õ????kit lens?õ???ù.
You will get great photos, but there are still physical and technical limitations for professional applications, output, and scaling. (For camera nerds I am alluding to something like crop sensor vs full frame here, or range of image file formats and image sizes.)
If you have a fantastic mic and a decent pre-amp you are good to go.
This is like putting a higher-end camera lens on a semi-pro camera like the Canon 70D.
It will almost always benefit you to have a mic that matches or surpasses the quality of your recording system (depending of course on what you are trying to achieve).
But, there is a threshold. Pairing a $3000 lens with a basic camera body isn?õ????t necessarily going to yield a better performance from either ?õ???? in audio terms, running a high-end mic into a hundred dollar audio interface/pre-amp will most likely not take full advantage of what the high-end mic is capable of doing, and vice versa, running $100 mic into a $2000 pre-amp will be the inverse of that.
Anecdote:
I have the latter issue myself. I own entry level mics but use a top-tier audio interface with world class pre-amps.
This is roughly equivalent to putting a two hundred dollar kit lens on a full frame professional DSLR ?õ???? it works, after some fiddling and hacking to get the blasted thing to fit, but the ?õ????camera?õ???ù itself shows up the shortcomings of the ?õ????lens?õ???ù in almost every shot.

What are the signs and symptoms of autism in a 10 month old infant?	"This is a good overview:
If autism is caught in infancy, treatment can take full advantage of the young brain?õ????s remarkable plasticity. Although autism is hard to diagnose before 24 months, symptoms often surface between 12 and 18 months. If signs are detected by 18 months of age, intensive treatment may help to rewire the brain and reverse the symptoms.
The earliest signs of autism involve the absence of normal behaviors?õ????not the presence of abnormal ones?õ????so they can be tough to spot. In some cases, the earliest symptoms of autism are even misinterpreted as signs of a ?õ????good baby,?õ???ù since the infant may seem quiet, independent, and undemanding. However, you can catch warning signs early if you know what to look for.
Some autistic infants don't respond to cuddling, reach out to be picked up, or look at their mothers when being fed.
Your baby or toddler doesn't:
The following delays warrant an immediate evaluation by your child?õ????s pediatrician:
Please do not take a ?õ????wait and see?õ???ù approach. Get assessed early because the sooner someone has a diagnosis, the sooner services can begin to help. Children have the most opportunity to be supported to have fewer symptoms when they are very young because the brain is most plastic (which means has the ability to change with experience) at younger ages.

How do you know if you are asexual? I think I am.	"For me, there were several factors that led to me finding out that I'm asexual.
People at my school and people online would talk about how hot someone was and I would never relate.
My classmates would talk about how they hds a crush on so and so, or ask me who I had a crush on, and I would be incredibly confused and unable to answer.
Nudity is just a natural thing, I would never have the desire to look at someone nude.
There have been many circumstances where people have flirted with me, and I have been uncomfortable and not known how to deal with the situation.
Of course, these are just things that I experienced, and the way people figure out theyre asexual varies from person to person. You can really only figure this out for yourself. However, I would say that if you think you might be asexual, you probably are.
I hope this is helpful!

Either that or learn to appreciate that everybody has different interests and although his are not in the hard sciences that there is a place for them in the world. In a relationship it is OK to not always agree on things and in fact it would be really weird if you did agree about everything.
But it is how you manage them that is a key to success. To be able to spend a long time in harmony, let alone in a loving relationship, with another human being you really need to be able to respect that person in spite of all of their idiosyncrasies. If not then your relationship will be pretty much doomed to fail.
I?õ????m a hard sciences person myself but I have, over the course of my life, been forced to learn to appreciate the ?õ????soft sciences.?õ???ù One thing you might consider is the difficulty of quantifying the human mind. There are certainly a lot of soft, fuzzy and rather crackpot concepts about how the mind works but over time much of that gets sorted out in the scientific world - it takes a longer and more circuitous route in psychology because you cannot isolate and study single variables with living organisms.
Mathematics is a pretty cut and dried science and all other sciences are based on it and in fact mathematicians can be pretty condescending about the ?õ????purity?õ???ù of their field over all others. So you might want to consider that your boyfriend has to put up with a holier-than-thou girlfriend same as you are putting up with a touchy-feely guy. Bottom line is if you can?õ????t respect each other for who you are and accept the value that each other brings to the relationship it will die a horrible death.

"As a student, what is the most obnoxious answer a teacher has ever given you?"	"Original question:
Eleventh grade biology term paper, worth 25% of my grade for the semester. I was a bit of a geek in high school, and I had chosen the Saturnidae moths of the U.S. as my subject.
Side note here, these are the huge, showy moths that are attracted to lights in the late spring and early summer, there are few enough of them to make a manageable subject for a paper.
I collected butterflies and moths at the time and had mounted specimens of most, but not all of them, so I made color plates of all of them. I spent hours on those plates, doing and re-doing them until I felt they were as good as I could get them, and added a written exposition on every one. I turned in the project expecting to get a decent grade on it - I was good at biology and I knew it, but the teacher and I did not get along at all. She had replaced a teacher I idolized who had left suddenly for medical reasons. As far as I was concerned, she didn?õ????t measure up. As far as she was concerned, I was a just a smart-ass who made her life difficult.
I got the paper back with a C+ grade and a note that said ?õ????you picked a subject that you already knew well, and didn?õ????t do enough work on it - see me after class.?õ???ù
That after-class meeting didn?õ????t go well. I protested that I had done a great deal of work on the project, that it met all of the stated requirements and deserved a better grade. She waved that aside and then smiled and informed me that my grade could be much improved if I would leave her the plates for her own use. This was my first experience with blatant adult duplicity, and it shocked me to the point of incoherence. I don?õ????t even remember what I said, just that I grabbed the plates and the paper and ran out of her classroom. I never mentioned it to anyone - honestly I didn?õ????t know how or what to say, and took a B- in a subject that had otherwise been a straight A for me.
Later, I gave those plates to my older sister, who taught elementary school, she used them for years. It was a valuable lesson for me, but a painful one.

Are Sunnis being opressed in Iran?	"I never lived in Iran, but being a Shiite that follows Imam Khamenei rules, I don?õ????t think so.
The Supreme Leader of Iran, Sayyed Ali Khamenei, always urges Shiites to be closer to Sunnis in his speeches, and always speak about the importance of the unity between them. One of the main reasons of disagreement between the two groups is the attitude towards the first three Islamic Khulafaur Rasyidin, and Mother of the Faithful, Aisha, the wive of Muhammad (pboh). Shiites believe that these figures have done wrong things, while Sunnis believe them to be fundamental in the formation of Islam and refer to them with utmost respect. To reduce conflict about the issue, Imam Khamenei issued a fatwa that prohibited Shiites from insulting symbols of the ?õ????Sunni brethren?õ???ù and the Mother of Faithful, Aisha:
This fatwa even brought on criticism from other Shiite figures who believe that cursing these Sunni symbols are a part of the sect?õ????s ideology and should not be prohibited.
Imam Khumeini, the predecessor of Imam Kamenei, even started the celebration of the ?õ????Week of Islamic Unity?õ???ù that Iran still upholds. Sunnis believe that prophet Muhammad (pboh) was born on 12th of Rabi?õ???? Al awwal (month) while Shiites believe the birth was on the 17th. To bring unity, Imam Khumeini initiated this week in which ceremonies and commemorations are held to celebrate the birth.
It?õ????s hard to measure how these things translate on ground, but as far as ?õ????being oppressed by authorities?õ???ù - I highly doubt that this happens. It would be more helpful to give examples about what you mean by oppression to be more accurate.
It?õ????s important to note that there are minorities with far less members than Sunnis in Iran. The Sunnis make almost 5?õ????10% of the population, while there is only about 9,000 Jews left in the country. The only form of ?õ????oppression?õ???ù I found against Jews is that they cannot hold high office. Other than that it?õ????s hard to call them oppressed, they can openly exercise their faith, and have a representative member in the Parliament. I found this link:
If that?õ????s how it?õ????s for Jews, I think one can hardly make a case for the ?õ????oppression?õ???ù of Sunnis.

Why is it easier to meditate when one isn't in the most comfortable position?	"This is not true. You should be comfortable. Especially when you begin meditating. You are trying to realize the awareness that is beyond the physical and mental perception and if you are distracted by physical discomforts, it will be harder for you to realize this awareness.
There is a path of Yoga (union with God) that deals with mastering the physical. It is perhaps where Hatha Yoga came from. It deals with being in various positions and remaining in them for long periods of time (hours often). Part of it is about awakening the flow of energy from that position. But as many of the positions are quite difficult, it pushes the practitioner to go beyond physical pain and discomfort and remain in a transcendental state of consciousness that is free of physical sensations.
But for most people, it is much better to be comfortable in meditation. It is good to learn to sit straight without back support. This helps the energy flow and also if you start to fall asleep, your body will start to fall over and you will automatically wake up to catch yourself. But once you get used to this position you will find it is quite comfortable.
But you do not want to be distracted by physical discomforts if it is possible. Because then your attention will be caught up in the discomfort. And you want your attention to relax out of being involved with the the physical and mental experience and into what lies beyond that.
Once you get better at meditation and you can rest in the awareness that is transcendent of the mind and body, discomforts can become a meditation in themselves.
Often if I get a headache or tooth ache, I will meditate by allowing the pain to be there completely and in that I transcend the mind and body into a level of consciousness where there is no pain, only formless bliss. In this way I use a certain amount of pain and discomfort as a meditation. But I would not seek pain out to meditate at all. It is more about allowing what is to be.
Hope this helps. I offer meditation music that helps awaken you into a state of meditation by transmitting bliss if you are interested. It makes the process much easier and more effective. You can listen to samples here

What is your favorite Capt. James T. Kirk quote?	"My favorite quote from Captain James T. Kirk is from the episode
?õ????They used to say if man could fly, he'd have wings. But he did fly. He discovered he had to. Do you wish that the first Apollo mission hadn't reached the moon, or that we hadn't gone on to Mars and then to the nearest star? That's like saying you wish that you still operated with scalpels and sewed your patients up with catgut like your great-great-great-great-grandfather used to. I'm in command. I could order this. But I'm not because, Doctor McCoy is right in pointing out the enormous danger potential in any contact with life and intelligence as fantastically advanced as this. But I must point out that the possibilities, the potential for knowledge and advancement is equally great. Risk. Risk is our business. That's what the starship is all about. That's why we're aboard her. You may dissent without prejudice. Do I hear a negative vote??õ???ù

Do I need to do cardio?	"Well, getting rid of love-handles has more to do with your diet than cardio. Cardio is not going to help if you are not going to control your diet. If you are foodie you can go for cheat-meals(eat whatever you want to once a week). Another things, Cardio is important part of workout not just for fat-loss but because it helps your heart to cope with extra weight you have put on. Imagine you have gained 5 kg of muscle mass now your heart has to work hard to pump blood to this extra kgs of muscle mass you have gained. What cardio actually does is makes your heart strong enough so that it can pump blood effectively. You might have seen people who have good muscle mass but get tired easily because most of them never do cardio which builds endurance. (Muscles need proper oxygenation which means less fatigue).
Instead of doing steady state cardio do

Can I call Child Protective Services on my parents for not getting me a phone?	"Your parents don't owe you a phone. You sound like my kindergartener who says, ?õ????It's not fair that other parents let their kids play on their smartphone, but you don't. I only have a tablet.?õ???ù No form of a phone is a requirement for good parenting. Kids need love, discipline, food, clothing, shelter and mental stimulation to thrive. Not having a smartphone, or a phone of any kind, is not a form of abuse anywhere.
If you call Child Protective Services to report abuse because you don't have a phone, you'll be lucky if all they do is laugh at you. You and your family may be subjected to mental and physical examinations to ensure that every child in the home is not being abused. Your parents are likely to be very upset about your behaviour, if they're not already. If you are old enough to be charged as an adult for a false accusation of child abuse, you could be charged with a crime, which would lead to even more expense and possible jail time.

What is going on psychologically with someone that desires to be a internet troll? Are they immature or do others take things too seriously?	"I think it?õ????s a combination of both.
Many a times I view ?õ????internet trolls?õ???ù as people who might not feel adequate contributing useful material to specific topics or sites, and in venting that sense of insecurity they seek instead to destabilize and contend with anyone and everything, for the sole purpose of getting some attention.
This can also be developed into a sort of sport, or a habit, which can then turn into a toxic cycle. I have seen some folks for instance, rather than formulating answers to questions in these sites (Quora and the like) reading through other answers instead and picking them to pieces. They might be right in some cases, in others they?õ????re just trying to prove their worth by discrediting others unfairly, rather than build them -or correcting them kindly- and then providing their own view.
Are some of them immature? Probably, but would not consider it as a rule of thumb.

What are the differences between the Chinese and Japanese Martial Arts?	"The (widely known) Japanese martial arts are more?õ????. modern.
Almost all of what you think you know as Japanese Martial arts is a product of the late 19th and early 20th century. it is based on traditional arts but the changes were monumental.
(There was no such thing as Judo before
Judo was more or less invented after 1882. Karate wasn?õ????t even seriously known in Japan until after 1922.
They are actually quite different from the traditional marital arts taught before that (which has since adopted a lot of their organizational and training system. )
There were serious room to develop and grown these things as a combination of a lot of western ideas and also modern organization ( especially the adaptation of Judo into the police force )
The Chinese martial arts that?õ????s known today (at least the once your thinking about. ) were not such things. it was like the old Japanese system where people more or less practiced in secret, and in Japan?õ????s old cases it was practiced by the upper class of their society while in China?õ????s case it was the lower class that practiced. This meant that preservation of knowledge was also more difficult.
For a lot of the practices, only really the form remains, the form is something that appeared to make memorization easier, it?õ????s the easiest thing to teach .
The secrete of how to practice your body and/or how to actually apply them in combat were often lost, or poorly passed on.
This isn?õ????t me guessing here, there were debates in the early 20th century in China about this, as martial arts classes became more popular and open in China as well, there were open complaints that a lot of the ?õ????teachers?õ???ù who?õ????s goal is to make a fast buck, mostly just taught forms and little else, as the ?õ????other stuff?õ???ù tend to be too physically taxing and probably scare away a ton of their customers.
China was also a much more chaotic place in the same time span where Judo / Karate developed and thus had much less money and general environment to work with.
That being said, it?õ????s not like such attempts didn?õ????t happen.
In 1928 the KMT government after finally more or less securing a degree of stability and unity in China opened the Central Martial Arts Academcy (
The next year they set up a national even in Hangzhou, where they invited any one willing to come forth and basically spar in the ring. this was a event where their really were old monks and such that came forth etc and major figures from all sorts of sect came forth.
The result was that they were basically all crushed by the younger trainee in the academy.
It has been only since the 80s really that the CCP have finally started to take this seriously and started the
We?õ????ll see, I figure things like Taichi is probably developing closer to the Judo system in a lot of respect.

"In real life who wins more, the good guy or the bad guy?"	"Hello , first of all this a very good question .
If you are asking related dating , getting attention of course its the bad guy.
People today prefer pleasure over pain . Good guys always have rules , discipline . They usually are deep thinkers and they want to see the world differently and understand small things . Girls won't prefer this kinda guy. You may have seen in school or college that usually the bad guy who cracks up jokes , talks to girls and do all the nonsense stuff gets the most attention. Girls don't want to date nice guys anymore, it bores them. Because they are the emotional support when girl is not feeling good and a shoulder to cry on when another guy breaks their heart or use them intentionally.
Bad guys are usually confident in day to day lives . I would say confident lier which really helps them to say what they feel without feeling hesitated whereas good guys suffer more usually because they feel like they can't be loved , which really affects their self-esteem and they're not able to say what they feel.

Do you do a pull test with your landing gear up or down?	"For safety reasons this should be done with the dollies down. In a freight yard you get to do this about 10 times a day and is an even bigger problem in the cold. . There is nothing wrong with doing a pull test as soon as you pin up, there is no need to hook up your glad hands first as the brakes on the trailer are all ready applied. Your also only trying to insure that the jaws locked you don?õ????t need to and should not drag the trailer, you just give it a little tug. This in no way relieves you of the responsibility of climbing under the trailer and visually checking the locking pin, it is just one more test.
As a tip for rookies running in the cold (-40 here) it is a good idea to mix antifreeze with the axel grease you put on your fifth wheel. Antifreeze is a great lubricant and unlike grease it won?õ????t freeze up or get stiff. It will keep your trailer from freezing to your 5th wheel if parked overnight and it keeps your locking mechanisms working smoothly. It is also great for preventing trailer brakes from freezing on. Running in the bush and deep snow the snow will get into your drums where the brakes heat things up. When you park the water runs around the pads and freezes them in place (I can?õ????t even count the number of times I have seen guys with tiger torches trying to get their trailers to move). The solution is to keep a sport bottle (pick one with a little hose or straw built in) full of anti-freeze on the deck. When you park and before you apply the trailer brakes you go to each wheel on the trailer and squirt just a little bit of antifreeze into the inspection hole on your brake covers. Ta da, no more frozen brakes.

What are the chances of BJP making a government in West Bengal?	"The original question is :
Very simply, there is always a chance for a party like BJP to come to power in WB: on the contrary the others major parties too can form government on either side, at least there are chances.
To be frank, unlike northern states the voters of Bengal will think twice to vote BJP for their only issue is Hindutva in the disguise of development. At least 125 assembly seats out of 294 in Bengal are dominated by Muslim voters, and all they have witnessed the recent events developed in UP. Surely, they will not vote for BJP. And, majority of the secular votes will be divided into TMC, Left, and Congress. Though, in the last assembly election BJP has got a fine chunk in overall vote percentage but, that is not sufficient to form government.

Have you ever been outsmarted by an animal?	"I was outsmarted by a bear. It was many years ago, and it was my first encounter with a wild bear. I had been stringing up our packs (bears had not yet learned how to find the tie point and break the cord; this was
I followed the bear, from a distance, and finally found my pack; he had taken all the food out, and left the rest. That was fortunate, since it had most of my warm clothing within. The pack had two large gashes where he had clawed it open; I still own that pack, and I show it to people occasionally.
Ten minutes later the bear returned. Everything had been hung up by then, but I still didn?õ????t like him being back, looking around for something else to steal. By this point, I had gained courage (maybe because of how quickly he had left the last time); I picked up a big stick and swinging it, I charged at him. He scampered away.
Thinking about it afterwards, I realized I had been pretty stupid, and never in the subsequent decades of backpacking did I ever run after a bear again.
My wife Rosemary did. She lost her temper (and this was decades later) when a bear stole her chocolate bars; she chased after it (this was at 2 am) but it outran her. She should not have done that, but losing her chocolate bars on the last night of a week-long backpack trip made her furious.

What books of the Bible did Paul write?	"There are 13 epistles attributed to Paul in the New Testament: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus and Philemon.
7 of these are almost never disputed by reputable New Testament scholars: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians and Philemon.
This doesn?õ????t mean that the other 6 are always disputed.
The most commonly disputed are Ephesians and the pastoral epistles: 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus.
Colossians and 2 Thessalonians are also sometimes disputed, but less convincingly.
You can find a brief summary of why these books are contested here:
Note: Some think that Paul may have also written the book of Hebrews, but most will admit that we don't know who wrote Hebrews. Suggested names besides Paul include: Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Luke, Priscilla and Apollos. But it could have been someone else entirely.

How many kg can I lose in 5 months?	"First, you do not need to wait to attend university or anything until you lose weight or gain weight. Weight has nothing to do with admission to any place. All are welcome in all public institutions.
You should see yourself as being in a lifelong effort to be at a healthy weight. And you should start by losing weight responsibly and in a way you can sustain. I would suggest you lose weight at a rate of 2 pounds a week (or 52 pounds over a year) or even one pound a year (26 pounds a year) until you get to a healthy weight.
The focus of your weight-loss program should be moving to healthier foods. Cut sugar back as much as possible. Cut junkfood snacks as much as possible. Cut bread as much as possible. Cut high-fat foods as much as possible.
Eat with friends and fill yourself with joy, not empty calories.

Why are some atheists so offended by people offering to pray for them?	"I?õ????ll provide the details that the question did not. Apparently a nurse was fired from her position at a hospital in Kent.
She admitted she may have spoken to a few patients without their express permission when she first began the job. But she was more careful after a warning in April this year that there had been complaints and her approach breached conduct guidelines about discussing personal beliefs.
In June, Mrs Kuteh was ?õ????shocked?õ???? to be told three further complaints had been made, after which she was told to stop assessing patients and was suspended a few days later.
She was sacked in August after an investigation, and her appeal was rejected.
Mrs Kuteh, who is taking the trust to an employment tribunal with the backing of the Christian Legal Centre, claimed her disciplinary process was flawed as she was not initially shown the complaints.
Emphasis added was mine.
The OP makes the claim that the government should have ?õ????no place in religion?õ???ù and I would agree. But that means that their employee should not be able to preach about their faith to vulnerable patients while serving as their nurse. If she is, she is obviously creating a place for her religion in the services which the government provides.
What so many religious people don?õ????t realize is that many situations
I?õ????d probably not complain about a nurse who just offered to pray for me. But if she offered up some platitudes like ?õ????offer your suffering to God?õ???ù or ?õ????God has a plan?õ???ù or some such nonsense, I?õ????d probably be fairly irritated.
I don?õ????t know if her firing was appropriate, but I don?õ????t dismiss the possibility that it could have been warranted. It sounds like she was warned at least once before, and the trust operated on multiple complaints. I?õ????ve no reason to believe that she?õ????s not sincere in her belief that she did nothing wrong, but that doesn?õ????t actually mean she didn?õ????t do something wrong.
If I were to give advice, it would be this: illness is not an invitation to talk about your religion. If you want to pray for me, that?õ????s fine. I couldn?õ????t stop you even if I wanted to. You could probably tell me without irritating me, as long as you were competent at your job. But I don?õ????t need to hear about how religion has helped you in your life, any more than I need to hear about your vegan diet or how your aunt beat cancer by drinking lemon juice.

"If a = 11 (242) 121, b = 14 (392) 196 then, find c = 13 (?) 169."	"Thanks for the question.
The answer is
There is a specific pattern in the numbers. The rightmost number of an equality is the square of the leftmost number on the same side. Example, 11^2 = 121, 14^2 = 196, and 13^2=169.
The next part is to see the second pattern to solve for the ?õ??????õ???ù. The middle number the twice of its right number. Example, 121*2=242, 196*2= 392.
Therefore following the same convention, we have 169*2=338.

Thank you Amrit Negi, for point out that 196*2=392, and not 396.

Which current NBA coach had the best career as a player?	"Luke Walton! Just kidding!
Jason Kidd is the only answer here. Kidd was one of the best leaders of all-time and made every team he played on better by a substantial amount. I hate the Nets but I thought he should have won the MVP in the 01-02 season over Tim Duncan. He took a historically terrible franchise and immediately led them to back-to-back Eastern Conference titles.
Kidd is among the all-time leaders in assists because of his extraordinary court vision. He seemed to know where everyone on the court was at all times and how best to utilize them. Shooting was probably the weakest part of his game but he managed to make it to third on the all-time 3pt. FG made list behind only sharpshooters Ray Allen and Reggie Miller. He was also a very good defender and one of the best at rebounding the ball for his size and position.
I mentioned Kidd's leadership skills which goes hand-in-hand with his high basketball IQ. He was clearly well past his prime during his season with the Knicks but played a huge part in making them relevant once again(they're not anymore). Kidd was one of the few that demanded Carmelo Anthony's respect and helped him have his most successful season while leading them to the second seed in the East. Kidd's body finally gave out on him during the playoffs and the Knicks couldn't survive without him.
Furthermore, Kidd was co-rookie of the year alongside Grant Hill, a ten time All-Star, made the All NBA First Team 5 times and the All Defensive First Team four times.
There are others who had good careers and contributed to very good teams such as Doc Rivers or great teams such as Steve Kerr. They were good players in their own right but not in the class of Kidd.

Why are motor insurance companies allowed to charge different premiums to different segments of the population?	"Discrimination only attaches to decisions based on your membership in a protected class.

Insurance companies are a legalized form of gambling, called
Because the game itself isn?õ????t a fixed odds game, like roulette or blackjack, there are odds-makers involved. They are called actuaries.
Actuaries are a type of statistician, who specializes in determining relationships between dependent and independent variables. They find causation from apparent correlation of variables and results.
For example: statistically, men are more likely to be involved in car accidents than women, because men are more likely to drive drunk, street race, drive aggressively, or exhibit ?õ????road rage?õ???ù. All of those things are independent variables, upon which the dependent variable ?õ????probability of an accident?õ???ù depends.
To do this correlation, they rely on a mathematical process called
It?õ????s the most boring type of math there is (according to me), if you do it by hand, and I suspect it?õ????s why it?õ????s pretty easy to get a job at $80K/year, on average, and usually double that, if you are very good.
You?õ????d probably be paid more to do the same job for a sports book, however.
In any event: the insurance companies entire business model is based on discrimination, but only in areas where it?õ????s actually legal to discriminate. In other words, based on protected class.
So they can discriminate based on, say, age, credit score, income, zip code, and so on ?õ???? all strong indicators of race in many instances ?õ???? but
So if you have a bucket of ?õ????everybody?õ???ù, and inside that bucket, you have two buckets named ?õ????male?õ???ù and ?õ????female?õ???ù, and in the first bucket, you have more buckets labelled ?õ????under 25?õ???ù and ?õ????over 25?õ???ù, and so on?õ????
You divide the population into risk pools, and you can determine the probability of needing to pay out an insurance settlement based on which smallest bucket someone ends up in.
And not only that: you can do the math and figure out the average amount you?õ????d have to pay out per incident, for each of the buckets.
And then you charge that amount, plus your operating expenses, plus your profit margin (the houses ?õ????take?õ???ù).
Why do they discriminate?
The single provision of the ACA that was really required to make the pre-ACA system better was really the anti-?õ????
If the medical insurance companies could not discriminate based on that ?õ???? if it had protected class status, as in ?õ????regardless of existing medical conditions?õ???ù ?õ???? that would have pretty much fixed the private healthcare system in the U.S., as far as most people were concerned.

What are 8 simple rules to be happy in life?		
Why are customers so lazy? Why do they ask for help instead of reading the signs at the grocery store?	"Please, forgive me for saying this but it sounds like there is an attitude check that needs to be done here?õ????.
When you aren?õ????t working, you are the customer. In this scenario it should be pretty easy for to put yourself in the customers shoes and think like one for a little while. However, to entertain the question, a few key points:
Stores here in the US are HUGE. If someone like me (yes me personally) walks into a store it is very easy to get lost or confused or even to stand in the correct aisle for 10 minutes staring at the item I am looking for and still not see it, purely on account of how all the product just blend together especially if they haven?õ????t been faced up properly.
When I used to work in retail, I could have told you where every single item was in that store, take me to any other of the same chain and I could usually find whatever I was looking for in a matter of seconds but that is just because I worked there long enough to learn how the layout and the design process worked for that chain. Ask me now though 10+ years later and I would have to do it the same way as everyone else, stand at the door look around a bit then walk up and down each and every aisle I thought likely.

Do people of Tamil Nadu love Marathis?	"Thanks Shiv Viswanathan for those interesting insights. Also others who have mentioned Shankar Mahadevan and Hariharan as well.
Now, as a Marathi who has learned a bit of Tamil culture, I think I should answer this.
Like the ancient age, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra have been closely associated in recent history as well. The most prominent of this collaboration was that of Lokmanya Tilak and Subramaniam Bharati. The great Tamil poet was a confidante of Tilak so much so that he said,
Bharti said of Tilak:
Those who are determined to serve this land until death speak the name of Tilak as the Saivites speak the name of Namasivaaya.

Va. Ve. Su. Iyer was the close associate of Veer Sawarkar running their revolutionary activities from London during from 1905-09.
In popular culture, nothing or none signifies the bond of two states than this man ?õ???? the reigning superstar of the Kollywood ?õ???? Rajinikanth. He is a Maharashtrian and does not hide his antecedents. Yet, he is also quick to vow his foremost allegiance to Tamil Nadu.
In Rajinikanth's movie Raja Chinna Roja, there is a scene in which I comes in a tribal attire at the villain's den. The dialogues in this particular scene are not in Tamil but in Marathi ?õ???? his native tongue. Now, hardly anybody in non-Tamil speaking India or in Tamil Nadu itself noted this fact.
Rajini's contemporary Kamal Haasan is also a Marathi aficionado. His second wife Sarika was Marathi. Even before that, it was reported, he was familiar with Maharashtra and speaks impressive Marathi. In Shri 420, a remake of his Tamil Avvai Shanmugi, he appeared as Lakshmi Godbole, a typical Marathi middle-class woman.
Even before them, Shivaji Ganesan, a legend in Tamil Nadu, got his screen name thanks to his prowess in depicting the Maratha king in numerous plays. Shivaji Ganesan shared a cordial relationship with Lata Mangeshkar and her family who considered him as her brother.
I recently read in a Marathi daily that Tamil Nadu has more drama on Shivaji than Maharashtra. Incidentally, Rajinikanth's original name happens to be Shivaji.
Even M. G. Ramchandran also had a healthy bond with Maharashtra. I read it somewhere (I am not sure, may be wrong) that the fur cap that he wore was gifted to him by V. Shantaram.
When Sayaji Shinde played Subramaniam Bharati in his biopic at the start of this millenium, the viewers called him Sayaji Bharati thereby making him a permanent fixture in many flicks to come. Many other Marathi actors like Nana Patekar, Sachin Khedekar, Atul Kulkarni and Mahesh Manjarekar have appeared on Tamil silver screen and viewers in turn have only loved them.
In literature, Dnyanpeeth-awardee Marathi author V. S. Khandekar has been extensively translated in Tamil. The Tamil translations of his Marathi novels may easily be the most translated Marathi books in any language save English.
And all this was not without reciprocation. Marathi people have high regard for the Tamils and often cite their love of mother-tongue and culture.
Recently, Vishwanath Khaire has written a book showing that Marathi has evolved from Tamil and not Sanskrit.
Most of all, Marathi people feel indebted to Tamil Nadu for giving shelter to Chhatrapati Rajaram, second son of Shivaji. King Rajaram protected himself in the fort of Jinji (or Senji in Tamil) for nine years when Mogul army marauded his home territory.
And to top it all, the word for Maharashtrian culture in Marathi is Marathmoli and guess what ?õ???? the word moli comes from Tamil
Having said that, one must say that the language has created a kind of distance in both the states. Especially after the formation of linguistic states, the interaction between the languages and culture is less.

Can you learn to play lacrosse alone? Is it possible?	"Short answer is yes, long answer is no.
You can learn the rules, sets, slide packages, rides, clears etc etc online pretty easily. There are plenty of resources there. Wall and dummy dodging will make your stick work better. Hit the gym or workout to get stronger and faster. Get in shape by running.
So yeah sure, you can learn to play.
The problem comes when you try to talk that to the field. individual work is crucial to become a good player, but its hard without real game time. You dont know what its like to try to read the offensive sets, while trying to communicate the slides with the rest of the D, while trying to keep track of your man, while trying to suck wind after a 4 minute shift. You just cant simulate that in your back yard. You cant simulate dodging on a real defender, or shooting thru traffick, or being one on one with a goalie, or getting your shit leveled. You get the point. The fundementals will be there, but they wont be enough.
Now with all that said, if I had to learn to be a lacrosse player all by myself, here are tips.
Thats all I got for ya. Goodluck.

"If God isn't real, then why do a lot of people still believe in religion after thousands of years? Do atheists think about this?"	"Would you have been for those things, if you existed back then, simply because most people would have been fine with that?

?õ????Saying something is true because a lot of people believe it to be true is an argument from popularity, which is the logical equivalent of saying ?õ????
Throughout human history, religion made sure it stayed around using various methods. For example:

What is your 'height' of Civil Service (UPSC IAS) preparation?	"So, it is the second week of April 2014, 3 and a half months before my first(and thankfully last prelims) and I have just started my UPSC preparation. Needless to say my life is in chaos. So I am looking at the syllabus and planning to move to Delhi and I am like, History? I have got this. I was the best student in my class in history (conveniently forgetting that that was back in 2006, before I took PCB, before India saw its first female president, before i was made to learn the names of all the muscles and bones in the body etc etc). But somehow I decide I am pretty good at ancient and medieval history stuff, so I am not going to waste time reading books, I would rather solve some test papers. So this morning, I am taking a test of ancient and medieval history from one of the photocopied question papers of one of the coaching institutes and predictably it was not going well. This is when my mother enters the room with a glass of milk.
Mother, ?õ????
Me, ?õ????
Mother,(peering into my test paper from behind my shoulders) ?õ????
Important addendum here is my mother is a chemistry graduate and a home maker with no interest in history what so ever. The maximum I expect of her is to know that Humayun was Akbar?õ????s father and that is it.
Me, (thoroughly irritated now) ?õ????
Mother, (rolling her eyes now as if it was the most obvious thing in the world) ?õ????
Me, (giving her my undivided attention now) ?õ????
Mother, ?õ????
My head fell in my hands.
I closed the test paper and added NCERT Medieval history to my art and culture schedule with a heavy heart.

How do jointer and planer differ?	"Ah, subtle.
The jointer is typically less expensive. It is used to make one side of a piece of wood flat and square. It has a blade on the bottom and you slide the wood over it to make your surface flat. It will not guarantee anything about the other side. So if your wood is shaped like a long wedge, it will still be a long wedge, but one side will be perfectly square.
The planer makes sure that the 2 opposing faces of a piece of wood are perfectly parallel to each other and that the thickness is uniform. Now, you could potentially have a wavy piece of wood and after the planer it may still be wavy but perfectly parallel.
Typically, the wood you buy from the store you can eyeball as straight so the planer tends to be more useful, especially if you need a perfect 1?õ???? or 1.5?õ???? thick piece of wood. (e.g. to match on some siding or finish carpentry). You would buy a 8x2?õ????, for example, and plane it down to get your right thickness.

Do you believe in love?	"Yes, very much so. I believe it and nothing will ever stop me to believe in love. I?õ????m a big romantic but I also believe, love is not enough. It first needs the other person to also show intent of interest with me and it?õ????s not one sided.
And there were other things too.
I invested a lot of time in gaining knowledge and experience in the following:
The knowledge in them and more has helped me to give love the help it needs. The women I date also benefit greately from the knowledge and experience. These skills allow me to help the relationship to such a level, that it has enriched the relationships I am in with the women I date.
So I believe in love, will always believe in it but I am mature about it. I know it needs help and I know I got the knowledge, experiene and conviction to make it work.

"After the heart and lungs stop working, what is the brain doing?"	"The brain is the most complicated part of the human body. All other parts of the body is striving protect it, save it. Brain needs constant flow of nutrition and oxygen to function. When your heart stops working the flow of nutrition and oxygen stops. If your lungs fail too then the purification of the carbon di oxide also stops. Right now your brain will utilize the nutrients that are present in the cerebrospinal fluid. In order to oxidize this it requires oxygen. Since there is no oxygen available it goes to anaerobic oxidation. The byproduct of anaerobic oxidation is lactic acid which will result in the degradation of the nerve cells. Once specific amount of damage occurs it will be to late and the brain stops functioning permanently. So only if your heart stops you only have one and a half minutes to resurrect you before you begin to suffer serious brain damage. The brain takes about 6?õ????7 mins to shut down completely and if it does you will die.

Why does it take so long to reclaim all of Syria?	"Because of all the fronts that the Syrian Army and its allied militias are currently fighting in.
No side in this conflict has the overwhelming manpower needed to launch a blitzkrieg all throughout Syria. The Syrian Army is fighting on around half a dozen fronts currently, which prevents them from concentrating all their forces on one single front to completely clear it and capture it.
The Tiger Forces, the elite unit of the Syrian Army, were liberating massive amounts of land from ISIS in the eastern Aleppo countryside.
But the Tiger Forces were then forced to relocate a large part of their forces to Hama when the rebels launched their latest offensive (which has since bogged down), which slowed their progress in the eastern Aleppo countryside.
That's why it takes so long. The Syrian Army is fighting on too many fronts at the same time, which doesn't allow them to regain territory rapidly throughout the country. The same thing happened to the Kurds when they were advancing towards Raqqa and had to divert forces to deal with the Turkish proxy rebels that were attacking them in Northern Syria.

Do Muslims believe in the Holy Spirit?	"Yes. Holy spirit means Allah. God is unimaginable and invisible no body can see Him or experience Him. This unimaginable God enters an energetic form in the upper-world to become ?õ????Father of Heaven?õ???? or ?õ????Allah?õ????, in the upper world. When the same God enters a formless energy it is called Holy Spirit. Thus Allah =Father of Heaven= Holy Spirit.
This Father of heaven or Allah or Holy Spirit enters a selected devotee on the earth known as Son of God to become Human incarnation of GOD to preach divine knowledge. Thus Krishna, Rama, Jesus, Holy Mohammad etc are such God in human form only in which Father of Heaven or Allah or Holy Spirit existed from their birth to death. Whoever has seen such alive human form of God had seen Father of Heaven or Allah or Holy Spirit only. There is no other way to see or serve Father of Heaven or Allah or Holy Spirit . When God comes to this world by meeting Him you have met Father of Heaven or Allah or Holy Spirit . By serving God in human form of your time you have served Father of Heaven or Allah or Holy Spirit. This is the only way for human being on the earth to meet, serve Father of Heaven or Allah or Holy Spirit . No other way than this. God comes in every human generation
God is unimaginable and hence, cannot be even imagined by even sharp intelligence. Therefore, there is no possibility of any kind of interaction with God.
Hence, God comes in human form. If God comes in the form of an inert object, our service becomes impossible. For the sake of inert objects, He has to come in the inert form. But, the inert objects do not interact at all. If He comes down as a bird or animal, the birds and animals may interact and the human beings cannot interact. In such case, you cannot talk with God since you cannot talk with a bird or animal. We cannot clarify our doubts with God in such case.
Therefore, the human incarnation interacts with those few selected devotees only, who conquered the ego and jealousy. For other human beings, the human incarnation behaves like a co-human being only following the usual social norms.

What flavor of science denial do you find silliest?	"Flat Earth because its just so easy to disprove. Now days you could buy your own go-pro send it up in a balloon and get pictures of the curvature of the Earth. Observation of the ISS is also good proof, as its orbital speed would need to vary tremendously to maintain its orbital shape.
The others are harder to directly disprove. Evolution by natural selection has the most accessible evidence for it. You need to account for fossil records, and the many layers of different rock structures. You can do experiments with bacterial cultures to show some quite rapid evolutionary adaptations.
Humans going to to moon can be verified with a strong enough telescope or bouncing laser off reflectors installed by men.
The others are all much trickier to disprove as they require careful analysis of lots of data. With climate change you can get data from individual weather stations and show warming trends. Getting your own data is hard as you need a long time scale to see directly observable effects. Still a trip through the north-west passage would be pretty good evidence that the atlantic ice is retreating.
For vaccines you really need to get a lot of data looking at prevalence of autism and vaccination rates showing no correlation. This can only be done with large cohort studies. For me this is tricky as I know someone who daughter has been classified as autistic, and the mother has told me that she had a bad allergic reaction to the vaccine which involved temporary loss of breathing. I?õ????m unsure about the anecdote, I know the daughter and she has some mental health problem but I don?õ????t know if it is classic autism, the mother is known to have an interesting relationship with the truth and I don?õ????t know what other factors have led to the daughter's condition. Even with the one awkward datapoint the benefits of mass vaccination are pretty clear with near eradication of many diseases.
For GMO?õ????s at the time they first came out in the 1990?õ????s there was a strong case for a precautionary principle. This was a new factor we were introducing to the environment and it was not really known what the consequences would be. There were plenty of other cases where human activity had introduced novel species to different environments with disastrous consequences. Now we have 30 years of experience and no serious consequences. There are some cases of cross contamination with other crops. While there are no serious scientific arguments against the crops there are political ones which have some merit. GMO?õ????s are often linked to specific pesticides like Roundup so can encourage its use and there is something killing the bees. The positive benefits may be oversold. There can be a economic problem with GMO seeds controlled by multinationals and there are associated problems of rural poverty and indebtedness.

What would inside a black hole look like?	"You would still see a porthole to the outside universe. But you couldn't move in that direction. Both you and the light hitting you from the outside are being drawn inward.
If you were to look towards the center of the black hole, you wouldn't necessarily see all black. You would be catching up to photons from things which had previously fallen in. Such photons would be vainly trying to escape, but still moving towards the singularity. So, if your buddy went in before you, you'd see a past echo of him as he fell in, looking out at you telling you

"Will Trump endure as the worst US president in history, or do the Republicans have more in store?"	"Who knows what the future will bring but think about it.
Herbert Hoover who ushered in and endured the depression would endure
Tricky Dick Nixon who was so paranoid he has to have flunky bug the DNC offices
Bonzo Reagan who was a nice guy but, whose policies brought on a massive stock market crash, a massive real estate market crash, and a banking crisis that cost American taxpayers half a trillion dollars. And then there was the Laffer curve Reaganomics tax cuts that were supposed to increase economic activity and tax revenue but only created the biggest sea of red ink in the history of mankind. An oh,he was already in the grip of Alzheimer's by the time his second term rolled around. Maybe that's an excuse for his disasterous presidency. But then most of that disaster should be dumped on George HW Bush
And then there was George W Bush. We hardly remember the disaster that was the Bonzo precidency since W outdid him in just about every possible way.
Before I get to Trump keep in mind the Republican Party?õ????s first choice was Jeb Bush. We are talking a man who spent 8+ years staring at his navel trying to decide if he had the right stuff to be president. Then, when the press lobbed in the softest of softball questions - knowing what we know now would you have pursued the Iraq policy your brother did? Not ?õ????if you had been in your brothers shoes what would you have done??õ???ù Jeb spent a week fumbling around trying to come up with a coherent answer. He was completely clueless that someone might ask such a question, and he was surrounded by aides that had no clue how to help him think his way out of it. Donald Trump sure pegged him right when he called Jeb ?õ????low energy?õ???ù. Imagine if that guy had somehow become president?
And now Donald Trump. In fairness we can't say whether he follows in the footsteps of so many other Republican disasterous presidencies and even outdoes them all although he certainly hasn't got off to a good start.
However Trump turns out I will bet that the Republican Party won't learn from all its mistakes of the past century and will keep throwing up disasterous presidents.

What is an acceptable Uber driver rating?	"I think My Driver rating is acceptable.
The company line from Uber is that 5-Star ratings are expected.
If a driver drops to a 4.6 average (currently calculated from the last 500 Rated Rides, but in some areas they are testing the last 100 Rated Rides, similar to Lyft), they may be Deactivated form the platform - eg: no longer contracted (fired).
So what does that mean? I could drive 100 people around, none of which ever rate the ride and I would have a 5.0 Rating. If I drive 100 people and only 1 person rates the ride, the average is that rating. So a 4 Star would be My overall rating.
Even ?õ????worse?õ???ù, or more meaningless, drivers do not get any feedback with a rating, nor do passengers get feedback from drivers. So I have given 800 Rides. 600 of those were rated (which is pretty unusual IMHO). Of those 600, in the last 500, <1% have rated Me a ?õ????2?õ???ù. I can?õ????t imagine why; I expect they were uberPool riders unhappy with the detours and delays on their ride to fetch and drop off other passengers.
One rider made Me wait over 10 minutes for them to get to the car. I cancelled the ride and they re-requested. They marked Me a ?õ????1?õ???ù and I had to justify the ride with Uber, but uber let the rating stand. I currently have a 4.89 Rating thanks to someone that wasted valuable time on my part and cost him $5, most likely which uber refunded after making a stink. Yet My rating takes the hit.

How do I update iOS 10 Beta Version?	"iOS 10 has been available in the beta program for a while and Apple has just released the final release candidate of iOS 10, which you can download right now.

Why some websites are loading very slow (or not at all) when www is omitted?	"Poor configuration where DNS has no way of knowing what to do with a request for a machine called www under the domain name it is authoritative for and possibly the web server has no idea of what to do with the request for www with the domain name it knows to otherwise answer for.
Usually if the request is on port 80 and the dns sends it to the web server for that domain name it will respond back with a webpage?õ???? possibly the wrong one even.
I always CNAME the www to the domain unless I have a reason to do something different or the wildcard points to the proper server. Even then I usually declare the www just to be consistent.
Often the www is removed or added within the htaccess or http config file.
There are cases where a website might want a server to answer as www and another server to answer as the domain itself.
There may also be a reverse proxy in front of the web server or your ISP may be running a reverse proxy to save bandwidth. A miss or timeout on a reverse proxy will often render a blank page. You can help in these cases by hitting the reload button. Sometimes the page will then load and other times you?õ????ll see an error page or a second blank page.
Sometimes all the load balancers get confused and route requests to a dead server or a server that is too busy. Or the only server the site owner has is broke or busy at the moment you request something.
Use the reload button at least once when things go wrong if you?õ????re at all bothered about visiting the website.

Let?õ????s illustrate with ?õ????Taken?õ????. The Villain wants to harm Liam Neesen by hurting his daughter. Neesen fights back (sometimes he wins, sometimes he loses). Finally Neesen wins and daughter is safe.

You can apply this formula to any top movie. Hope this helps, Paul

Transcribed oral literature often has commonalities but it also has that with all oral traditions around the world. And the differences between those oral traditions are large.

I really think that to forces similar common elements is to not respect the reality of such different cultures and such different authors.

Someone who is first language Native is different than first language English.

In terms of 'munitions plants' I assume you are talking about manufacturing ammo. From what I know gangs are pretty ignorant in this regard but it is quite easy to to manufacture ammo. As a trivial example, one could buy a simple ""Lee Classic Loader"" and components (spend brass cases, primers, smokeless powder and bullets) and manufacture a perfectly viable cartridge in less than a minute with no more than a small hammer and a hard surface.

What's the best counter top stone?	"There are many different countertops in the market but choosing the one which suits you and your
Back in the days, you were lucky to have some faded laminate as a small prep area beside the sink. Now however, you can choose from hundreds of colours, patterns and textures, in materials ranging from natural stone and acrylic sheets to quartz and granite. Every countertop stone in the market has its own pros and cons and it?õ????s your job to choose the one which suits you the best.
Granite, once found only in expensive, high-end kitchens, is more commonplace today and is by far the most popular natural stone countertop material. Granite counters are sold primarily through local fabricators, but they're also available at many home centres and kitchen showrooms.
Each slab of this natural material is unique; rare colours and veining cost more. These stones would not get harmed by heat cuts and scratches. Furthermore, polished and matte finishes resists stains when properly sealed.
These tops however, needs to be sealed properly to fend off stains. Edges and corners can chip and must be professionally repaired.
Quartz has many advantages over granite, including that it?õ????s impervious to stains and stands up to acidic foods, and it does this without ever needing to be sealed. It?õ????s also far more scratch and chip resistant and it?õ????s generally considered a greener choice because it?õ????s made from waste stone and therefore doesn?õ????t require mining slabs or shipping them around the globe, both of which are carbon-intensive processes for natural granite and marble.
The downside to quartz at least for some people has always been that the patterns looked so uniform and consistent that they don?õ????t quite pull off the look of real stone. But lately manufacturers have figured out how to create irregularity in their quartz, effectively mimicking the natural-looking variegation of granite and even the swirls of marble, in a nearly indestructible material. Same as granite, the edges and corners can chip and may need professional help to be repaired.
Wood is another traditional countertop material that has lost prominence over the years due to the widespread popularity of granite and solid surfaces. Wood maintenance can be an issue, though. While polyurethane seals can protect a counter for a few years, many owners prefer to draw out the natural beauty and warmth of wood with a less glossy mineral oil finish. Maintaining an oiled surface, which requires reapplication every four to six weeks, is more of a commitment than most busy homeowners are willing to make. But, as with ceramic tile, there are secondary surfaces where using wood makes sense, such as a prep area, a dining counter or a food chopping block.
Solid surfacing materials such as Corian, Samsons, Staron are made of 100% acrylic, 100% polyester, or a combination of acrylic and poly. They're highly resistant to stains and scratches, and completely renewable and repairable. Scratches and burns can be sanded out, deep gouges can be filled. Seams are fused together to create undetectable joints. And the material comes in literally hundreds of colours and patterns, many of which resemble natural stone. It scratches and cuts easily, so a cutting board is a must.
Inexpensive, easy to install, and so much better-looking than you probably remember, thanks to new printing technology and decorative edges. However, cutting directly on it easily and permanently damages laminate.
Soapstone isn?õ????t as common as granite, and it?õ????s superb at resisting heat damage. Small scratches can be repaired by sanding finely and applying mineral oil. Limestone and marble are classic materials. Limestone also has a natural-stone look without heavy veining or graining and it resists heat.
However, the cons would be that, Soapstone nicks, cuts, and scratches easily, and some stains are too tough to be washed away. Limestone and marble also have those drawbacks, and excessive heat would damage marble.
These are the pros and cons of each countertop material. Of course, the pricing of Quartz, Limestone, Soapstone and marble are much more expensive but high in quality and durability. Also it stands your kitchen out and are best suitable for both traditional and modern kitchens. So if you?õ????re in a tight budget this would not be the perfect match.
Solid surfaces are also in the high range. However, it comes in hundreds of patterns and colours and would best suit any kitchen. This is the best match for a modern contemporary kitchen. However, it scratches and cut easily so a chopping board is recommended.
Granite tops are in the medium to high range. It is high in quality and durability and also is best suitable for traditional kitchen models.
Wood surfaces are in the medium range. Nowadays, people tend not to have wooden counter tops but to use them as breakfast bars or dining counter area. However, it all depends on your design. If your kitchen has a more traditional look, then a wood counter top would be the best match.
Choosing the right counter top material lies on the above mentioned aspects. Take those measures into count and decide what suits you the best. Go on

What is a list of multinational companies which have good potential in India but haven't penetrated the Indian market yet?	"I can immediately think of Netflix and Tesla.
Netflix is considered as Number 1 enemy of Hollywood. Netflix is behaving more like a film studio and invests heavily in its movie business and Hollywood doesnot know how to,react. The streaming giant has already changed its TV landscape with its bungle-able content offering that has enabled customers to watch shows when and where they want.
They have huge potential in India and it is only matter of time that they penetrate Indian market in a big way.
TESLA is the popular electric vehicle maker in US. The very name Elon Musk, its founder sends his fans to frenzy. Tesla is introducing economy model 3 shortly ( production facilities are getting ready). The company has to limit the bookings to 2 per person due to the overwhelming response. ($1000 for advance booking). Tesla giving other traditional car manufacturers run for their money and sells its vehicles directly to consumers ( unlike other car manufacturers). It may take couple of years more ( perhaps a decade) before TESLA commences its sales in India both due to poor purchasing power here and they are currently expanding to China and elsewhere.
( Apple still considers Indian market not ripe for their new phones due to higher price points and are looking at India only for refurbished ones.)

Why are Democrats so authoritarian?	"You might be referring to parts of the left that are authoritarian. I wouldn?õ????t put all Democrats or left-wingers in this category, though.
The main reason some lean authoritarian is that they feel they have a duty to protect marginalized groups of people (people of color, women, LGBT folks, etc.) from bigotry and hate speech. They would argue that inflammatory rhetoric that attacks such groups normalizes violence, prejudice, and discrimination, and thus needs to be stopped.
Not all people on the left agree with this line of reasoning and there is a diversity of opinion on the topic.
I could also pick examples where Republicans and conservatives are authoritarian. They tend to oppose flag burning and criticism of Christianity. They also tend to support ?õ????tough on crime?õ???ù policies and a strict law and order society with militarized police.

What is a simple explanation of how a positron travels backwards in time?	"Richard Feynman first came up with some details that a positron is actually an electron travelling backward in time.
To explain it in simple terms let me assume we have a happy enough (stable) positron in a matter devoid area. Now you apply an electric field to that container. The positron being positively charged moves away from the positive terminal towards the negative terminal.
Now consider you've got an electron in a separate identical container and you apply electric field to it. Here it moves towards the positive terminal. Videotape the movement of electron, play the tape forwards and then as soon as the electron reaches very close to the positive terminal rewind it and voil?ü?ˇ what you see in the ?õ????time reverse?õ???ù sequence of electron is itself the movement of the positron. So Feynman theorized that the positron is just an electron (considering it's other properties) but it gives us the 'appearance' that it's positively charged because it follows the path followed by a positive charge under the influence of fields while actually it can be an electron just moving backwards in time an retracing its original path backwards.

"Why do people say, ""stay away from processed foods.""? Isn't everything processed?"	"Most grocery stores are set up with produce, dairy, and meats on the outside walls. These departments contain many items that are general one to five ingredients.
Dairy and delicatessen departments are a mixed bag of a little processing/additions to Read-the-Label. Liquid dairy such as milk and cream are lightly processed with pasteurization and homogenization to prevent separation and insure food safety; milk has vitamin additions. Delve into the universe of creamers, single serve yogurts and there is an explosion of sugared fruits or syrups, plus a surprising amount of salt required for the tastiness we desire in soft and hard cheeses. Buy the products with the shortest list of ingredients and you can?õ????t go far wrong. Plain anything in yogurts, cream cheese and cottage cheeses is far more useful versus buckling to sweet temptation.
Here is the preferred backup to what you can?õ????t find fresh in the produce department. It is even accepted by many that frozen fruits and vegetables are often in a better state than fresh produce which took days to travel from the field or has been held in storage at the store.

If	"This is one of those problems that?õ????s interesting when you are first learning about exponents and logarithms but trivial with a little knowledge.
Anything raised to the power of zero is 1. This is where experience helps. With experience, this comes to mind immediately.
A^x = B^x has the simple solution, x=0, making the original equation 1 = 1.
So you have one solution and if you have learned to be careful (which math courses are good at teaching), you check for other solutions.
Take the log of both sides.
x*ln(7) = x*ln(49)
x = x* ln(49)/ln(7)
Again, with some experience you know x = A*x implies x=0, unless A=1. And you don?õ????t have to look up the exact values to know ln(49)/ln(7) isn?õ????t 1.
Have you learned about about imaginary numbers? Draw a picture of an imaginary number as a vector in two dimensional space (real numbers on the horizontal axis and pure imaginary numbers on the vertical axis). Multiplication by a constant makes the vector larger (if the constant is greater than 1) or smaller (if the constant is smaller than 1). Since ln(49)/ln(*7) isn?õ????t equal to 1, the only x that won?õ????t be changed is zero.
Someday, if you take enough math, you may learn about cases where x is a vector, or tensor, or matrix, or dyadic, or something more exotic. Remember this problem and reconsider it as you learn more math.

"I am an extensive abuse victim for last 33 years. From my so called mother and father to the extended family such as aunts, uncles and their kids who are older than me to inlaws, my baby's father. From physical, sexual to mental and psychological abuse. Funny, on my last answer I've read a few comments suggesting it's a fairytale. It amused me.
Anyways, I'm a very very strong person but if I am asked to weigh in on this question, I would suggest:
1) Don't force your opinions on her - you can of course suggest but respect her choice. Don't mock it or be little her if it turns out not so perfect.
2) Help her make friends by pointing out their positive traits. You think carefully though before suggesting because she will be trusting your insticts in the beginning like a tender crawling jasmine trusts the big tree for support.
3)Encourage it to have her own individual interests, hobbies and such.
4) Be positive. Sometimes it's difficult but that's life.
5) Be suppotive but don't let her depend on you. As I said she must make her decision with your HELP.
Good luck. You seem to be a good human being.

If God doesn't need us then why did he create us?	"Hmmm?õ?????õ???ùneed us?õ???ù might not be an accurate assumption, depending on exactly why God created us as HE perceives it all?õ????not how WE think He might perceive it.
Hopefully, that?õ????s not too confusing, though I can see how it might be. What I?õ????m alluding to is that God is so far above us in His consciousness, His capacity for Love, His never-ending patience with segments of His Creation that do not choose to pay attention to His overall Master Plan.
But, in my (humble) opinion, God not only completely ?õ????understands?õ???? humanity?õ????s foibles and outright rejections of His Master Plan tenets, commandments, and other principles He might WANT from His Creation; He also knows His Master Plan cannot fail, ultimately, because He does not make mistakes.

Is a paleo diet good for health?	"Our MD, who had a conventional practice up until six years ago, started incorporating paleo-based nutrition into his patient recommendations. He has quantified the data from hundreds of patients and has shown results in slowed, reversed and/or the elimination of diseases through nutrition alone. He is not prescription averse if the condition warrants it, but he always counsels with nutrition and exercise. And his position is that carbs and vegetable oils (except olive, coconut and avocado) in particular drive diabetes, heart disease, strokes, Alzheimer?õ????s, auto immune conditions, and cancer.
I?õ????ve been cooking and eating paleo for about five years and resolved a host of chronic health problems including hypertension, seasonal allergies and ocular migraines by avoiding wheat and vegetable oils. A rheumatologist recently told me that he had four patients within a month, each with a different problem, who were spontaneously cured by eliminating wheat.
My husband was happy to eat my food at home, but he ate out at work every weekday, consumed a lot of soda and sweets, smoked and had a heart attack on April Fools Day in 2016. He had three stents implanted, with blockages of 100, 80 and 80 percent. He could not leave the hospital without a physician referral (he hadn?õ????t had a doc in decades), and I found our MD who lists himself as paleo.
A year later, my husband?õ????s health is fabulous. All the tests show that his heart disease is significantly reversed and getting better with every checkup. He follows paleo 90 percent of the time now. After the heart attack, he was on four meds. This month he?õ????s been taken off two of them, and the other two have been reduced in dosage. He was told initially by the hospital that he would be on these medications for life. They also prescribed statins which my husband refused to take; our doc agreed with his decision. He has become a pho master. Every couple of weeks he makes gallons of bone broth and substitutes veg for the noodles. Bone broth is a pillar food in paleo.
As to the fad aspect of paleo. It?õ????s all so foolish. I suppose Americans in particular are prone to cultism. I?õ????ve always had a problem with the word paleo associated with this way of eating because skeptics dismiss the tenets with ?õ????Well, cavemen didn?õ????t eat ?õ?????õ???ù
Paleo is a shorthand way of conveying what the diet is all about. There?õ????s a picture in your head and it doesn?õ????t include golden arches, packages with cartoon characters or lists in a tiny font of preservatives and additives.
In the early days Loren Cordain, PhD, got the idea started and used ?õ????paleo?õ???ù to describe eating closer to the way that our pre-agriculture ancestors did. It stuck. It?õ????s a name. I know no one who is a paleo adherent who doesn?õ????t experiment with ingredients outside the ?õ????official?õ???ù roster to find out if they are tolerable or problematical and include or avoid them as a result.
I always cooked from scratch and cooked 80?õ????85 percent of our meals. It was important to me to give my family home-cooked meals. Up until five years ago, I followed the plant-based, whole-grain, low fat conventional way of preparing food. It made me sick and fat. It contributed to my husband?õ????s heart attack. I will never go back to that way of eating. And along with our MD, seeing the results in black and white numbers and vastly improved health, I?õ????m thankful to be paleo.

How can I tell my children I am not in love with their mom anymore?		
"If you were in a room with 10 people and one of them is a mind reader, what would you think in order to identify the mind reader?"	"I would mentally visualize somebody yawning: the largest, longest, most satisfying yawn imaginable. I would envision the highly contagious yawn spreading through an entire group of people, picturing in my mind every detail, until I myself feel the unstoppable urge.
And then I would yawn, meanderingly, mulling over every tickle and swell in my throat ?õ???? without ever parting my lips. I?õ????m exceptionally skilled in masking yawns, the only visible cue being a bob in my larynx that looks like a slow swallow. (Thanks, insomnia.)
Since there was no outer demonstration that could be identified as a yawn, the only member of the room capable of ?õ????catching?õ???ù the sensation would be the person reading my mind: this would protect against false positives from the other nine occupants.
So I would watch for somebody to yawn. Even if they were equally capable of masking it, the larynx bob would be enough since I would know to watch for it. And it doesn?õ????t even matter that they could read my mind to know what I?õ????m trying to do: the longer they think about my thinking about trying to make them yawn, the stronger their own urge to do so becomes.

What did black people do bad that they were enslaved?	"In our times it is only legal to enslave someone ?õ???? force them to work without pay or any compensation ?õ???? after they have been convicted of a crime. In other words, only people who have done something bad can be enslaved.

How can somebody who have a narrow perception of people become open minded?	"From my experience, narrow perceptions are made based on prejudices and biases. That?õ????s not to say that every person who is narrow minded is racist or homophobic. Even I will admit that, if I see a black man and a white man charging down the street in my direction, both dressed in hoodies and ripped jeans, I am more likely to be worried that the black man is going to attack me than the white man. Whether this is because I am white so will trust the white guy more or whether it is because of media reporting of racial divides or whatever it is, I will be more likely to fear for my safety from the black guy.
I don?õ????t, however, take that prejudice into other situations with black people. I have worked with plenty of black people and have not assumed with such immediacy that they are going to do something untowards to me. I have not felt unsafe around them.
I think the thing that makes me more open minded than most people I know is the realisation that we are all individuals. Each one of us has needs, fears, hopes, dreams, beliefs, desires, and every one of us has a past, a present and a future, and it is exceedingly rare that two people shall be equal in all of these areas. They talk about the ?õ????average?õ???ù person, but if you were to look at census data and use all of the data points there, you would be very hard pressed to find someone that matches every data point.
Every one of us is pretty unique. We may share traits with others, but we are our own person, and there is no person who is identical to us in every way.
Because of this, I can?õ????t treat someone the exact same way I would want to be treated - it needs to be modified to fit their personal needs and tendencies. Slowly, you realise that you need to do this for everyone. When you really understand what that entails, you start to see less groupings, less stereotypes, less generalisations, and you start to become more accepting of others.
Another key point is showing empathy and understanding. Something that people always seem to balk at is the knowledge that I can justify rape and murder and domestic abuse. I can look at a case and justify it. Note: I said ?õ????justify?õ???ù. I won?õ????t condone, I won?õ????t advocate, I won?õ????t agree, I will turn around and say that rape, murder and domestic abuse are wholly wrong. But looking at the details of the case and looking at the people involved allows me a better understanding of that situation. As a result, I can ?õ????justify?õ???ù it from the perspective of the person that has committed the act. I can even justify terrorism in the same way.
You can refuse to budge on whether it?õ????s right or wrong. That?õ????s your prerogative, and I won?õ????t challenge that. In fact, 9 times out of 10, I?õ????d probably agree with you. But by justifying it, you show that you are able to take a step back and look at it without your emotional biases taking the lead. You can break it down and look at its individual components and, based on your understanding of things, you build a picture where you can comprehend their reasoning. You can see how they got there. It?õ????s still wrong, it?õ????s still despicable, but taking that step back and looking at it gives you a better understanding of the situation. It also then fuels the idea that people are all individuals with a past, a present and a future.
The third key point is knowing that what you see isn?õ????t always what I see. ?õ????One man?õ????s terrorist is another girl?õ????s freedom fighter,?õ???ù as Rupert Everett said in the St Trinian?õ????s movie. Once you see that your view of the world is going to be different to mine, you further reduce the generalisations that create a more narrow minded approach.
I?õ????m not fully open minded, and I doubt I ever will be. I accept that there are some biases that I won?õ????t ever be able to let go of. And that?õ????s important: don?õ????t compromise on your beliefs about things. They are after all your beliefs. But if you find, in the course of your introspection and your self awareness, that your beliefs don?õ????t hold true, then you can amend them to something that you are more comfortable with. But don?õ????t change them because someone else said so or because you think it shows you to be more open minded.
Take the time to analyse and assess each situation on its individual merits. Understand how they got from A to B. And understand that what you see is from your vantage point only.
They?õ????re pretty good steps to follow, in my mind.

The ownership of an LLC is a matter of public record.

What is a good caliber for deer hunting/range shooting?	"If you want to combine those two, I?õ????d suggest a .308 or a .30/?õ????06 in a bolt action rifle. If you do live in a state that actually allows .223 as a deer cartridge and you shoot enough to be quite proficient with it, that would also be a good one for double-duty as you describe.
The laws of your state and the conditions of your hunting grounds determine what is suitable to use for hunting deer. If you want to do serious range shooting, you want something that is fairly abundant and cheap, yet is reputed as being accurate and available in accurate rifles.
A lot of the ?õ????hot?õ???? rifle cartridges for hunting are too costly to shoot in great quantity and would be pretty unpleasant, especially if fired from a lightweight rifle. Some very popular hunting cartridges are mostly found in rifles that aren?õ????t suited for extensive range use, especially lever action rifles.
Of course, if the ?õ????range?õ???? you describe is in your back yard out at the farm, you?õ????re really likely to be doing what is known as ?õ????plinking?õ???? more than anything else and just about anything goes there! If you handload your own cartridges, you can make the hot hunting cartridges tame enough to use for target shooting if you want to.
Some military surplus rifles can do both if your range shooting is to remain fairly informal. Many a .303 Enfield has been used for hunting, as have Mausers, Springfields, Garands, and just about anything else where ammunition is somewhat readily available. Just don?õ????t expect to be able to achieve quarter inch groups at a hundred yards with them, and you?õ????ll be fine.
You might consider what you?õ????ll be using it for most and base your decision on that.

What is consciousness? How does it occur?	"I absolutely love this topic.
So no one really has a concrete idea of what consciousness is or how it comes about, but here is my favorite theory
To help explain this we will use this analogy: a committee of scientists are trying to send a man (or woman) to the moon. Basically we have all of our separate processors in the brain doing their respective jobs (the different physicists, mathematicians, biologists, &c). Previous theories relied on an executive in the brain coordinating the communication between all of these different processors (one ?õ????overseer?õ???ù runs between all of the different scientists relaying information from one to another). Obviously this would be an incredibly inefficient way to communicate information between many people.
So now we give all of our scientists a chalk board on which they can present their respective findings, so that the other scientists can have quick and easy access to this information. In our brain, this ?õ????chalk board?õ???ù is

What would happen if I walked into Apple with a Windows laptop in my hand?	"The the first millimeter of your foot steps into the Apple Store. The brains of the employees at the genius bar immediately notice something unusual and turn their heads at breakneck speed.
The genius bar employees lock their eyes onto the object that you are holding.
Their brains have processed what it is. It?õ????s a Windows Laptop. They can tell by the malevolent glare in your face that it?õ????s also dual booted with Ubuntu- No, wait.
Pandemonium finally breaks out. A genius bar employee yells, ?õ????
The shock has mostly expired, and you step in the store a bit more to investigate. However, the Apple users have also recovered, and start throwing IPhones at you.
2
Confused and in even more shock, you start to run out of the store. Unfortunately for you, they deploy the A.A.P.S.D.S (Apple Advanced PC Supporter Defense System
3
With help from the other Apple users, they open the hatch at the back of the store and bring out the most dreaded weapon on the entire planet: The Airpods. Yes, Apple?õ????s final move to make sure their cult is loyal: no one else in their right mind would spend 200 dollars just for wireless headphone capability. Except for the Apple Cult. To prove their loyalty, of course.
They approach you with the weapon. You start to realize what will happen: as they put them in your ears, you?õ????ll be hypnotized using several high pitched noises. What comes after, you have no idea, but it most likely won?õ????t be very pleasant.
They?õ????re right beside you. You may as well say your last prayers and maybe find some paper to write down your will, if time permits- wait, is that a crack in the ceiling?
A rescue team! They?õ????ve come to free you from you?õ????re horrible fate.
Using the intense processing power of the Intel Xeon E7, they completely vaporize the Genius employees and scatter the rest of the Cult. The extreme power of the superior processors also bricks all the technology in the store, besides your PC, still in hand.
After planting some kind of?õ????.. bomb, maybe? They escort you through the ceiling via a magnetic platform, being attracted by something large in the sky?õ?????õ????.
You see the destruction below you as the bomb explodes. As you look up, you see this dark object getting larger and larger?õ?????õ????.
But as others have said, in reality it?õ????ll be completely ignored. In fact, it?õ????s quite normal as some people like to compare their computers to a Mac at the store to see if it?õ????ll be a good purchase.
Probably?õ?????õ?????õ????..

Should we make it as difficult for rich women to get abortions as it is for poor women?	"The other answers posted so far are right on point. We should not make having an abortion more difficult for rich women; we should make it as easy for poor women to access this medical procedure as it is for rich women to access it.
However, let?õ????s put that aside for a moment and look at what it would take to implement your proposal. Why is it difficult for poor women to have an abortion? Lawmakers force clinics that serve poorer areas to close. They require waiting periods, which force women to take more time away from work in order to have it done. The combination of travel, delay, and possibly higher costs (depending on the requirements of the facilities where the procedure is performed) takes it out of reach for poor women.
So, how would one go about replicating these conditions for rich women? For starters, there?õ????s the travel. You?õ????d have to prevent them leaving the country, maybe even crossing state lines. Depending on how authentic you wanted to be, you might even have to prevent them from driving at all. So, that means they would have to be required to surrender their drivers?õ???? licenses and passports, and any personal vehicles would have to be impounded. They would also have to be prevented from securing outside help to circumvent the restrictions, so that means they would have to be prevented from communicating with anyone willing to assist them. Poor women often cannot be away from work long enough to have an abortion without risking their jobs, so you?õ????d have to monitor rich women?õ????s movements to make sure they didn?õ????t go anywhere besides work, home, and any necessary errands, like food shopping. Speaking of shopping, one of the barriers for poor women is a lack of funds, so you?õ????d have to put a freeze on her assets so that she couldn?õ????t just throw money at the problem until she achieved the desired outcome.
Come to think of it ?õ???? forbidding travel, restricting movements, restricting communication, denying access to resources ?õ???? the most expedient way to achieve this level of restriction on a person of means is to just lock a rich pregnant woman in a cage until she delivers. Does that sound like a good idea? A
Because that?õ????s what we do to poor women, effectively, and it shouldn?õ????t happen to any woman, regardless of means.

"Have you changed your mind on gun control? If so, why?"	"I?õ????m hoping you?õ????re asking about stories going both ways, because in my case I was originally
First, a little background:
Once I was surrounded by officers in a grocery store parking lot, and then handcuffed. It didn?õ????t cross my mind until later that it?õ????s messed up to surround a 17 year old string bean, with weapons ready, then press him against a car and handcuff him (I didn?õ????t resist the police, which I have always respected). All of this turned out to be because a bag girl called, saying: ?õ????there is a suspicious boy outside, and he might be a terrorist?õ???ù (I was sitting under a tree in the parking lot waiting for my friend to get out of work). This was my first, and most memorable experience with guns in the US. If something had gone wrong, I would have been dead. Also, for some reason, I actually felt ashamed, even though I most certainly hadn?õ????t done anything wrong. This actually made me side with those who even wanted to disarm not just the public, but also the police (at the time).
Shortly thereafter, I was a freshman in the campus library looking up statistics for a research paper on gun control. I was told by the professor that he?õ????ll only accept well-researched papers with pertinent data to back up any claims made. The professor was the head of the English department at the time, and outlined in detail what to look for, to make sure we don?õ????t just quote statistics without looking into the raw data. This was because ?õ????statistics don?õ????t lie, but liars use statistics?õ???ù. While doing research on countries?õ???? violent crime rates (as it relates to gun control), I ended up finding solid data that entirely opposed my views. I couldn?õ????t find straightforward statistical information to help my argument anywhere. I found that places where the citizens were all issued weapons/permits, violent crime was incredibly low. I also found that places where weapons permits were more difficult to obtain (or guns were no longer allowed
The closest I could find to research helping my argument simply stated that it makes no difference.
In the end, my paper ended up being in favor finding a solution (outside of gun control) for violent crime, and I eventually even went out and tried target shooting (which I rather enjoy, to this day).

Should I choose PHP or Ruby for web development?	"The question is constructed in such way that it depends. Also ?õ????I have learned Ruby and PHP?õ???ù - it is a quite bold statement especially paired with such question. I am not assuming that you do not know some bits but ?õ????have learned?õ???ù make me wondering.
First things first. Basic website is a HTML document backed up with CSS for styling and JS for interactions. I simplify it here of course. The point is what tools you will use to generate that files is up to you. You can use or not to use a framework.
If you think about programming as a profession, you should be able to write something from scratch as well as using frameworks. Most projects use some frameworks as they make possible to have something working faster. They also organize some things, so especially when working in teams it make a cooperation process easier.
You cannot try everything at once, but try to familiarize with some tools and check what is good for what, what you like etc. It is best to use the right tool for the job, even when your preferences may differ. It is not so often the case, so we then see a lot of projects falling apart like house of cards after some time.
PHP is like a hammer that works better or worse in many situations. Learning curve to do something simple is probably smaller than in many other languages. There is a lot of cheap hosting for it available. But still, there are tons of complains about it, just check the Internet.
Ruby is more elegant, high level language and teamed with RoR can do pretty good things. Haven?õ????t use it from some time, but remember some problems with Gems compatibility. Also there are better choices as it comes to speed and scalability. Some big companies started with Ruby and then moved to other solutions. E.g. Twitter changed it to Scala.

Pets: How would a dog react if I tried to lick its face?	"Lots of great answers here and especially a good warning from
Face licking (particularly the nose as
I haven't ever licked a dog but I've hugged and tickled and played with many of them.?ˇ My worst experience happened earlier this year while grooming the winery dog, a dog that I've known for over 6 years and lived with for two.?ˇ He was laying on the patio and I sat down to pet him and pulled out a few stray fox tails (none of which were stuck in - they were just laying in the fur). I moved from the neck and continued back slowly toward the haunches.?ˇ He was relaxed and calm, laying on his side, his tail was thumping the ground and he seemed to be very much enjoying the attention.

What is laser propulsion?	"Laser propulsion is using the momentum transfer from the photons themselves to push something. It has the advantage for spaceship travel in that you don't need to carry your own fuel, a laser beam can still push you when you're light years away, and you can still transfer energy even when the object is traveling near the speed of light. The drawback is that it takes a lot of photons.

What is the most ridiculous thing you have heard a teacher say?	"I did my graduation in Business Administration. Irrespective of our majors, we were all required to take up a certain economics course titled ""Socio Economic Profiles of Bangladesh"". The topic was quite interesting, but the teacher made it one of the most torturous and boring classes I've ever had to endure.
His teaching style was simple. He loved the old fashioned stuff. Everyday, he'd bring in some hand written notes and display them to us using an OHP (Overhead Projector). I am not too confident that too many future Quora members would even recognize what an OHP is! This was in 2001 or 2002 when most teachers discarded OHP and moved on to powerpoint presentations, but this guy, didn't.
After displaying his ""stuff"" (no pun intended), he'd just ask us to copy everything that was written on screen.
Funnily enough, his entire lecture (photocopy of his scribbles) was obtainable from a photocopy shop stationed neared our campus. And he never changed the material.
So the smart guys would buy that and pretend to stay busy and copy his writings while doing other stuff in the classroom.
On a rare occasion, he'd stop showing us the OHP and start some sort of discussion on the subject.
On a day like that, he tried explaining the difficult topic of government borrowing. Naturally, it was like a festival day for us, as well as people who were doing a major in Economics. One person asked: ""If the government is stealing from the people, why do they need to borrow from banks?"" Another guy followed up with ""Why the government takes up money when they can't even pay off the past debts?""
Question after question followed, and he couldn't really cope with the pressure. Suddenly, he got very agitated and mentioned ""
And, the OHPs came back and stayed till the end of the semester.

Why do aircrafts use life jackets rather than parachutes for passengers?	"Short answer - parachute jumps require intense and continuous training, fitness and certification that is niche to combat pilots, defence personnel and sky diving sportspersons / enthusiasts.
Long Answer -
5,000 41.17 5
10,000 23.36 -5
15,000 5.55 -15
20,000 -12.26 -24.5
25,000 -30.05 -34.5
30,000 -47.83 -44.3
35,000 -65.61 -54.2
40,000 -69.70 -56.7
60,000 -69.70 -56.7
As you can see, jumping out of a parachute at any altitude higher than 10,000 feet is not a very easy thing to do and will be fatal to most. Moreover, commercial flights carry infants, children and senior citizens.
Even if one were to assume that all passengers were trained in parachute jumps, commercial aircraft are equipped with seats, toilets and galleys - not jump rails, jump masters and the equipment/infrastructure required for jumps.
In case of an emergency, it is far more practical for pilots to bring the aircraft down by losing altitude and attempt a land or water landing. In case of a successful landing or ditching in an ocean/river, flight attendants are trained to guide passengers in a specific order, using emergency exits and slides. Slides also double up as life rafts, ensuring a longer and better opportunity of survival.

How is Salman Khan better than SRK as a person (besides his acting)?	"Since you are not intersted about their acting prowess, I shall refrain from telling you that Shah Rukh, however repetitive and typecaste is a better actor than Salman Khan.
Having said that, both are huge superstars and both are human beings. So they have their faults and strengths. While SRK?õ????s crimes have not been to the level of Salman he too has been violent to a security guard at Wankhede stadium and had tiffs with Shirish Kunder, etc.
But the reason why SRK has to be preferred over Salman is his intelligence and inane business sense. Salman seems more simplistic with a limited skill set and riding on the same horse everyday and doing the same thing every time. SRK, on the other hand, has managed to successfully diversify into film and non film businesses. He is articulate and makes a lot of sense in his interviews. He is polished and savvy and usually has well thought out opinions and view points. Salman mostly has a foot in the mouth disease and still needs his father to sort out the mess he regularly creates.
Although I am a fan of neither, SRK is definitely preferable to Salman Khan.

Is it normal that I like being rejected by this girl because I am submissive to her (I get rejected by her a lot)?	"Haha. Maybe you are sensing her inner pleasure at being pursued. I don't know how old you are and if you reached your sexual maturity. Do you like being submissive? If you are still in school, I take it that she is flattered and that she welcomes your advances even though she is rejecting you. You lie it because you know you are still climbing the ladder
This reminds me of a buddy of mine way back in High School. He is ugly and the girl he was chasing was straight out of a Japan Anime. Cute and pretty as hell. To exotic for most guys to try to pursue her. And it's clear she hangs out with college guys ou side of us lowly adolescent kids.he peater d her and left love not s on her windshield everyday. He was harmless and not scary or stalkerish. In fact, she was flatter d even though she feigned indignation and annoyance.
One day the letters stopped. ?õ????hey. Where are my love notes?!??õ???ù
Girls love to be persuaded. If a guy puts that much effort demonstrating that she is the center of his universe (in a non creepy, non threatening way and free of social scrutiny), he suddenly become rhe number candidate for marriage. That's all girl- to be loved

Why do I forget things I studied so easily?	"Memorizing information at the end of the day may not be the right studying system for you. You are probably tired, have listened to conferences, ate without any other thought than ?õ????it has to be fast?õ???ù, and, if you indeed ate animal protein, carbs, you have given your brain an additional reason to be unable to retain information because of digestion fatigue.
Foods with a high glycemic index will make you feel tired because they provoke a rise in your blood sugar and later cause it to drop dramatically. Foods that are hard to digest will make you feel tired after eating because they cause your body to increase the blood flow to your stomach in order to be able to digest properly. This includes foods high in fat, such as red meat. Fried foods also fall into this category.
If you are anxious as you study, you increase the possibilities for the learnt material to not be anchored in your memory. Anxiety increases blood cortisol and depletes serotonin which is the key to the door of learning.
Depending on your schedule, it would be probably best to go to bed early and get up early, snack on fresh fruit as you study, drink two big glasses of water to hydrate your system and cleanse your digestive system. Have a bowl of nuts of various kinds to complement the fruit, they are high in protein (20 g per 100 g - sorry, I do metrics, just know that nuts are high in proteins) and other vital nutrients.
Research on memory shows that if you add a sensory experience to your learning process, you increase your capacity to retain what you learnt. It can be to have a high quality candle burning propagating your favourite scent. I would maybe not encourage a student to light up a candle in the morning though, forgetting to blow it off brings risk you do not want to think about. Smell your cologne on a tissue as you study, rub your feet on a foot massager, or other simple sensory information you can set up in no time.
If you use smelling, know that animal research and human research have showed that smell prompts relaxation by settling amygdala activity and increases your dopamine production. Dopamine is the most important neurochemistry mediator for memory. In the animal model, they found an increase of 100% which increase will maintain its effects and benefits to up to 2 hours.

"Spanish has the useful word ""hay"" meaning there is or there are. What is a similar word in French?"	"One cannot render the meaning of the Spanish word ?õ????hay?õ???ù in only one word in French.

What should I do if I meet a racist on the street?	"I am generally very low key, unless someone comes at me aggressively. I had an incident in a local Harrisburg, PA grocery store several years ago. Now, I am no kid....I just don't look my age. I was newly retired, and purchasing my groceries with my MAC card. It was the same color as an ACCESS (food stamp) card. An older white man in back of me sort of pushed me with his cart and started talking in a loud tone about ""black people living off white people's hard earned money."" I admit.....I lost it. I turned around, told him to back off, don't push me again. I then proceeded to wave my MAC card in his face, told him I worked all my life, and was retired, just like his old, racist, slovenly ass was and to back the hell off.

What are your grievances against the ISC BST 2017?	"This year Isc Bst 2017 had many questions
Types of Recruitment Interviews.
Characteristics of Motivation.
Need for Efficient Communication.
With Regards to Promotion.. Open and Closed.
But that's not the case with everyone!
Demotion.
Potential Appraisal.
External Communication.
Difference between Leadership and Management.
You might feel like it's just
For Eg..
U might say that Characteristics of Management is a Part of Meaning of Motivation? So why, I ask, has it not been clearly mentioned as in Commerce where every tiny bit is clearly mentioned?
Clearly Recruitment Interview too isn't mentioned in the syllabus (
Here's the catch..
Neither have Demotion or Open/Closed Promotion.. Potential Appraisal been mentioned anywhere.
So I ask
This certainly has no effects on me as I am sure I will score a Minimum of 90( worst case scenario) on the paper!
Rather this is for half a lac other students who too like me sat for the Bst Paper today aiming for High 90z .. Studying the entire syllabus patting themselves on the back for doing it.. And then seeing there dreams of High 90z getting crushed completely!
This also means a lot for Isc 2018!
This should be urgently looked into!
Pls Upvote it and share it as much as possible!
Ty!
PS: ISC's my Favourite Board but there are certain things that needs attention!

What's the worst response you have received on Quora?	"This was a particularly unpleasant thing that happened to me a few weeks back.
Someone asked a question in the topic
?õ????Can Jack Fraser solve the JEE paper??õ???ù
(For those of you who don?õ????t know, the JEE is an Indian physical sciences admissions paper for their universities - some people take it
I thought it would be a laugh to sit down and do the paper, and see how I did.
There were two papers, about 80 multiple choice questions each.

This is where I made my mistake.
Now, first of all I think I need to make some qualifications:

This stuff was pretty mild ?õ???? and Quora took care of the abuse well enough that I had no complaints.
But then some people took the issue
They found my

It was really rather traumatic.
I deleted the answer, and a few days later the entire question was deleted by Moderation.
I don?õ????t know if it was one guy using dozens of accounts (they were all fake profiles), or a cabal of several people,but eventually it petered out.
Facebook (slowly) dealt with it, and the stuff went away.
My Mum still refers to it as ?õ????The time that guy had such low self esteem that he considered me seeing his penis to be the worst insult imaginable?õ???ù.
So it?õ????s not so much that the response was
I?õ????m not going to answer any more questions about the JEE. It seems like it?õ????s a bit too touchy a subject!
* This would have been more threatening if it wasn?õ????t the top result when you google
PS. To the hundreds of people flooding to the comments section and my inbox to apologise for these people and assert that it's not all Indians - no need.
I am in fact madly in love with one of your countrywomen, and am perfectly aware that this is a small, idiotic minority. There is no need to fret that I am tarring all Indians with the same brush!

"In Macbeth, is Lady Macbeth the 4th witch?"	"Sure! Why not?
But really, there?õ????s a big difference between Lady Macbeth and the witches, so she doesn?õ????t deserve to be bracketed with them. The witches are devoted to evil from the beginning, and they can see into the future. They know what will happen to Macbeth, at least if he yields to the temptation to kill King Duncan.
Lady Macbeth is the catalyst without whom her husband would probably not have murdered the King, and she?õ????s enthusiastic about the project from the beginning. She urges him and showers scorn on him when he has second thoughts about committing the murder. But after the deed is done (with Lady Macbeth?õ????s own physical inspection of the scene), she wants Macbeth to stop. Very soon she realizes that she has created a monster: her husband turns into a mass murderer, and she can?õ????t control him. Then she actually goes mad.
Before the murder of Duncan, Macbeth had paused to meditate the crime. He began a famous soliloquy, ?õ????If it were done when ?õ????tis done, then ?õ????twere well/ It were done quickly?õ???ù (Act I , scene vii). Later, in her madness, Lady Macbeth maunders, ?õ????To bed, to bed; there?õ????s knocking at the gate: come, come, come, come, give me your hand: what?õ????s done cannot be undone: to bed, to bed, to bed?õ???ù (Act V, scene i). She is actually reliving the scene in which Macbeth, having killed Duncan, imagines that there is still blood on his hands, and it can?õ????t be washed off. At that time, she was the strong one, calming Macbeth. In her final madness, she suffers the same hallucination: ?õ????Here?õ????s the smell of blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand?õ???ù (Ibid.). Even more hauntingly, addressing the air, she says, ?õ????Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him??õ???ù (Ibid.). Soon after this, she takes her own life, while her husband fights on to the end.
So clearly, Lady Macbeth is no witch. As Macbeth becomes more homicidal, she becomes more vulnerable and conscience-ridden. She?õ????s all too human.

Have you ever walked out of an interview?	"A few years ago, I was interviewing with a well known software company at Mountain View. Before that onsite interview, I was scheduled to have a telephone interview with their senior engineer. She did not call me on the scheduled time for the telephone interview. Also, she did not even send me an email about her unavailability. I waited for her call for 2 hours, then I sent an email to my recruiter regarding the situation. The recruiter scheduled another telephone interview with some other person on different day. I felt that attitude very unprofessional, but I had the telephone interview anyway. Then I was called for an onsite interview. The recruiter gave me an entire schedule for the interview with timings.
I came to know that my first interview was with the same senior engineer with whom I was scheduled to have the telephone interview and didn?õ????t show up. I reached there 15 minutes earlier of my scheduled time, and was waiting in the lobby. She showed up 10 minutes late. Then she told me to come to one interview room. I went there, and she started the interview with a question about my current work. I started talking about it and it felt that she was not paying attention at what I was saying. She was searching for something on her laptop, and after 2 or 3 minutes, she asked me some Java-related questions, which I answered perfectly. Then she asked me about some unrealistic scenario-based questions and I tried to answer as per my understanding, and for 2 or 3 answers, she laughed at me. I was very annoyed by her attitude. Then she told me to solve a data structure question. It was about reversing a linked list. I knew how to solve that question and I started to solve it on the whiteboard. She didn?õ????t even have a marker for the interview, and I pulled my own marker from my bag. I started solving that question on the white board. On the first line, she interrupted and asked ?õ????what is that variable??õ???ù I answered, and she said that it was the wrong way of declaration. I politely replied to let me complete my logic, and I would correct my corner cases. She started laughing at me and said, ?õ????OK!! Try to do it. I don?õ????t think that you will be able to complete this.?õ???ù
I thought that is enough. I had tolerated her nasty attitude for a long time, and there is no reason to speak with an interviewee like that. I told myself, ?õ????Of course she has more experience than me, but there is no reason to insult someone during interview. I may not be as good at data structure as her, but the way she is talking is not right. She has no right to mock my knowledge and programming ability.?õ???ù
I told her, ?õ????You know what, I think I should rethink about working at your company. I did not like the way you are talking with me, and your attitude towards your interviewee is not good.?õ???ù
And I walked out of the interview.

How would you feel about a suicidal character in a novel being killed after getting their life together?		
Why are actors taught not to look directly at the cameras?	"In plays and film there exists the concept of the ?õ????Fourth Wall.?õ???ù The invisible barrier separating the audience from the action that they are observing. Much of the work you need to do goes into maintaining this illusion.
When an actor looks straight into the camera or the audience, it destroys this illusion. It's basically the equivalent of making eye contact with the viewer. The viewer isn't supposed to be there. No one is supposed to be there. So who is it that they're looking at?
This kind of thing makes it impossible to uphold the illusion that the entire thing isn't staged, decreasing the investment of the audience.

Is rap a reflection of reality?	"This question may he broader than you realize. I am assuming you mean this in the sense that gangster rap is often scolded but defenders of it will say it's a reflection of the reality many of the artists lived with. At the heart of it this is just as broad as saying Is poetry a reflection of reality. It certainly can be, but it can also be about having fun, or it can be lies, or it can be about spreading a message, or fluffing your ego. It's meaning is rather open to anything.
Even if you look at the origins of hip hop, many agree that DJ Kool Hercs end of summer party kicked it off in August 1973. That party was just about having fun and for a while that's what hip hop focused on. As it blew up more there started to be deviation. People realized the music could have a political effect, it turned to realism, often telling the stories of the reality around them, and to calls for justice.
That stream of hip hop was mainly centered in the east coast. In the west coast gangster rap first came to be and people were surprised to hear and actual reaction to the world around them. It wasn't a call to justice or a story of the good kids. It was about the ones who were in the gangs or caught up in their business. And people could relate to it. It didn't condemn that life style either. At times it even celebrated it.
The world is different but just as it was before ever song can have a different intention and purpose. A close look at both the lyrics and the artists expereiences can probably tell you what the purpose is within two google searches.

"Do you find any value in the theory that Captain Kirk represents the Freudian ego, Bones the id, and Spock the superego?"	"Yes. The Rule of Three is one of the most dominant tropes in storytelling and the Freudian Trio is an incarnation of that. Three is a very significant number for humans. It is the number of pieces of information at which patterns become evident. Evolving pattern recognition keeps us alive longer. When our brain is processing new information and the hippocampus is trying to interpret the new stimuli in comparison to existing stored information, it detects patterns. Our brains appreciate groups of three. We find them engaging and comforting. Throughout storytelling history, authors have relied on this innate feature. That's why we get three musketeers, three ghosts of Christmas, three little pigs, three fates, three wise men, three blind mice and so on and so on.
Good storytelling also requires conflict and balance. Using the Freudian Trio form of the rule of three gives authors the perfect sandbox.
Would
Would
The Freudian Trio trope not only provides conflict, but it serves as a narrative tool. The id and the superego characters can serve as forms of exposition. They describe the options for the protagonist and then the protagonist must choose which path to follow. It?õ????s hard to follow a story in which we observe the protagonist making choices without having those choices shown to us.
It is important to note these roles can shift and morph depending on the situation. When Kirk, Bones, and Spock were together, Kirk, a born leader, naturally fell into the role of ego, Bones, a creature of compassion, naturally fell into the role of id, and Spock, a creature of reason, naturally fell into the role of superego. But remove one of the characters from a scene and roles would change. Kirk would become the id when alone with Spock. McCoy would push Spock to become the ego, when they were alone together. And when Kirk and McCoy were alone together, McCoy would often take on the role of superego.
This structure would continue with the later shows. There is a reason the three most popular characters of

"Is 60% throughout enough or not at NICMAR during placements (for top construction companies), along with having 2 years of site experience?"	"Short Answer -
It isn't really a deal breaker. You can still have a promising career even if you have underperformed in a one off 10th/12th.
Long Answer -
Its not the end of the story but I wouldn't go as far as saying that it doesn't matter at all, some companies (5-7% at NICMAR)do use the basic min 60 to 75 % criteria for filtering resumes during placements in order to reduce the number of students to screen during the process (though its a very rudimentary process and a lot of MNCs are refraining from it gradually).
BUT it isn't necessarily a stumbling block for your career, as long as the you have done well in the latter part of your career (graduation and MBA scores) and more importantly, overall, as a person, you don't fit stereotype of a person who 'typically' scores below 60%, in terms of consistency, reliability, dedication and partly intellect and soft skills.
If you are a good enough candidate for the job, fitting all necessary competencies, 8 out of 10 times your 12th % won't matter.
PS - I myself scored 55% in 12th (though I had an above average score during the latter part of my academic journey and have relatively decent communication skills)

The US was offended by Mexico continuing to trade with the Germans, and talked about taking over the oil fields in Tampico and taking over Veracruz again in yet another military campaign that may have included invading the whole country.

Should I use Quora to ask people to make a story for me for school?	"?õ????
Quora is not your homework machine.
If someone else does your homework, and you put your name on it, that's plagiarism. It's academic dishonesty.
And depending on the school, punishments range from getting a zero on the assignment, to being expelled.

Should I just end things? My friends do not care.	"I'm sorry you're depressed and in pain. It truly sucks. Most people won't appreciate how bad it can feel. But why are you allowing ?õ????friends?õ???ù and other externals to determine your life and its value? The meaning and worth you give to life comes from within; what's outside it's always subject to change, loss, and creating disappointment. Also, it's always a mistake to try to treat friends and family members as substitute therapists. See a professional who will listen and give you tools to deal with your depression. If you're like most depressed people, you victimize yourself with your thoughts. An example: my friends don't care about me, they won't even respond to my text messages even after I tell them I'm depressed and their silence hurts me. You don't know why they are texting you back. Maybe they don't know what to say. Maybe they didn't get your text. While it's possible that they just don't care, you can't know this without direct information. Most likely this is a projection, assigning motivations that fit your inner narrative.
I strongly suggest focusing on working through your depression and involving yourself in activities that enable you to spend time with others in activities that don't focus on how you're feeling. Volunteering and focusing on the needs of others is a great way to shift your focus outward and it benefits you as much as the people you might be helping. Put down your phone and exercise, outdoors if possible. Create a garden. Take a course on foraging for wild foods. Take a drawing class. Read to an old person. Live rather than think about living (or killing yourself-which would only inflict suffering on others). Show others by your actions what an incredible person you are.

"She told me that she is straight, but she keeps asking me what if she and her crush were kissing in front of me or holding hands. What does it mean?"	"I am sorry, but I don't understand what sort of validation you are looking for.
Officially, you yourself are not a romantic interest and she has a crush on a man (or so she says) and is verbalized this hypothetical situation to gauge your reaction as you are a female and you don't know his ?õ????crush of hers?õ???ù personally? Meaning, that you do t hate him because of bad history or that you used to date him?
If this is the case, then is sound like she is going through a period sexual orientation confusion. Maybe she is confused about her feelings and instincts toward you and men. It's a tricky topic to bring up if you are genuinely attracd to her. I will assume that you are gay and attracted to her, which is safe to assume because I don't think she would consciously tell you that she is straight when the understanding was that she has a crush who is a man.
Tell her you would be envious. Say no more. Don't push the topic or try to be th ?õ????neutral?õ???ù this party and push her to be gay. Let her figure it out and fill in the. Lamps without too much help from you. If she knows you have feelings for her, that's good enough. Any nudge or push from you during her period of discovery would be catastrophic.
She knows you like her but one day another girl might catch your eye. She is already pondering what it might be like to commit to you. Why else would she dangle her man friend in front of you. She has a thin veil of ?õ????propriety?õ???ù by asking you this hypothetical and sticking either her statement of being straight
The othe secemario is that she is truly straight, concerned that you have feelings for her, and asked you if you would find it insensitive if she kissed her crush in front of you. You have a better feel for her motivations than I would. Being a former Law Man, how a person speaks is more telling than the words themselves

Is the electride of an anode thinner than the electrode of a cathode?	"It depends upon whether you are speaking of an electrochemical cell or an electrolytic cell.
The electrons are lost at the anode. So, there is an accumulation of electrons at the anode. These electrons move to the cathode, via a wire. At the cathode also, the metal has lost some electrons but not as many as the metal at the anode. Still, there are some cations of the metal here. These accept the electrons coming from the anode side and turn into metal atoms to deposit on the metal electrode (cathode). So, the cathode is thicker here.
However,
When you apply an opposing electrode potential from an external medium, such that the applied potential is more than the cell potential then, the flow of current is reversed. The direction of the flow of electrons is also reversed. This time, the electrons flow from the cathode to the anode. So electrons are accepted at the anode side so that the ions get reduced and turn into metal atoms to get deposited on the anode, and oxidation takes place at the cathode. So the cathode becomes thinner in this case and the anode becomes thicker.
In this case, when electricity is passed through the solution, the metal at the anode is dissolved from the anode as they release electrons and at the cathode, these released cations accept electrons and get turned into metal atoms, to get deposited on the cathode. So, the cathode becomes thicker, and the anode becomes thinner.

Well technicall ?õ????no?õ???ù, your an either play field hockey, or figure skating?õ????. But if you are Canadian, neither options will have lots of opportunities.
So, the short answer is ?õ????no?õ???ù, it is possible to pursue ABAP and HANA separately without one another. But the long answer is although it is possible, doing one but not the other will significantly limit your opportunities.
The fact is HANA was introduced because other databases run into significant performance limitation for SAP ABAP stack. So, while there are a few customer using HANA without an SAP ABAP application server, (I?õ????d bet less than 10% of HANA customers do not have ABAP instances), HANA was designed with ?õ????simplifying ABAP stack?õ???ù in mind, and in fact many SAP ?õ????Simplification?õ???ù are ABAP code adopting HANA by either pushing down calculation to HANA, or optimize logic and data structure to take advantage of HANA.

"If you were in a survival group during a zombie outbreak, what contributions would you make to your group? What would you do?"	"Although I can't do it on that scale, I am very good at creating rudimentary traps and simple devices using whatever I can scavenge.

It came with a working gate that raised and lowered, a basic pulley system to translate power in different directions, and a booth that you could stand up in, all made using basic materials. I wish I had taken a picture but basically it was a very primitive version of this with only one gate:
With that knowledge, I could probably create devices such as water collectors, alarms, ?õ????automatic?õ???ù security systems, basic generators (the most basic generator is simply an inverted electric motor, with rotational input connected to the motor shaft), lighting systems (solar powered garden lights), etc.

I believe the free market should pick winners and losers
I believe in less regulation, but not ?õ????no regulation.?õ???ù The role of government is to defend the nation. Environmental protection fits inside that definition. Regulations that protect our investment markets, banking system, educational system, etc. are all critical. Regulations that limit where an insurance company can offer a particular policy seem stupid to me.

I believe in gay rights, but not special rights. You want visitation rights in the ICU, equal treatment in the tax code, equal protection in divorce court, etc.? Get married. Let?õ????s ensure that is legal everywhere. No pseudo-marriage domestic partnership stuff. Real marriage.
I believe in broader LGBTQ rights, such as using restrooms for the gender identity. But, I admit I don?õ????t know how to handle locker rooms for minors. Should a 15 year-old girl have to see a 16 year-old pre-op?õ????s ?õ????junk?õ???ù while sharing a locker room? I?õ????m not smart enough to sort this one out on my own. I see both sides and I feel bad for both sides. But that?õ????s a pretty big difference than letting someone use the stall next to you in a Target restroom.
I believe in the death penalty. Certain crimes / criminals are so heinous that we?õ????re better off removing that evil from this planet, even if it costs us more than imprisoning them. But, I think Texas goes too far. I also believe in a woman?õ????s right to choose an abortion. I?õ????ve never understood how the left is okay with abortion, but generally against capital punishment or how the right is the reverse.
I believe we need to raise taxes, eliminate many loopholes, move most tax credits/deductions
I believe we need to fix Social Security. We should be increasing the age to get benefits and we should means test those benefits. Bill Gates and Warren Buffet do not need social security checks. But, we should have a method for people to appeal for hardship payments. Jobs that are almost literally back breaking work can?õ????t be done into someone?õ????s 60s, so we need a way to look out for those folks while white collar employees push on a bit longer.
I believe in real immigration reform. Expand H1Bs, but enforce minimum salaries by a range of job codes, minimums that are far closer to local wages. Create a path to citizenship / amnesty for those who are here already. Make it easier for people to come, work, leave, and come back, again.
I believe we should legalize marijuana and tax it. I believe we should release from prison
I believe we should make a Constitutional amendment against for-profit prisons. Nobody should financially benefit by incarcerating someone in this country. It creates stupid incentives.

What happens when a child is abused?

Then my dad died unexpectedly ?õ???? in front of our eyes ?õ???? when my siblings and I were all in the 2 to 8 year-old range.

He was horribly screwed up in his head. To describe the physical abuse to which he subjected me and my siblings would take a book to write. Suffice it to say our childhoods were and endless array of savage beatings for virtually nothing. To be honest, we DID do wrong stuff as kids. He was just never smart enough to catch us and reasonably punish us for any of that. His vicious beatings simply had no connection to reality.
And the physical abuse to which he subjected us was nothing compared to the psychological torture he put us through. To be under 10, and beaten ruthlessly over the rise in gasoline prices???
So how did
I went to a university that everyone on Quora seems interested in knowing how to get admitted to, worked for a few years in one of the most interesting and important public sector jobs I could find, went to grad school at a university so tough that its motto, if translated into English, would be ?õ????Where fun goes to die . . . slowly and in great pain,?õ???ù did another really cool and exciting public sector job for a few years, and then went into the private industry where I was very successful till I retired early.
My personal life? Dated some great women along the way, had a few heartbreaks along the way, and now I?õ????m married to the most wonderful person I?õ????ve ever met. I?õ????ve had and have a good number of friends ?õ???? not a huge number, but every one of them is very close and very special to me. They?õ????d do anything for me, and I?õ????d do anything for them (except give up a great steak dinner). I exercise to work off the tension in my life, I still go to shrinks when something big happens in my life and I feel that it will take some real effort to work through it.
And my kids. It?õ????s tough. But whenever I feel myself getting mad at them, I stop and think about what my stepfather would have done. Then I do the opposite. I?õ????m far from a perfect parent, but I certainly don?õ????t abuse them.
So how did I come out this way? Good genes? A few years of good parents? A few teachers and outside adults who ?õ????knew?õ???ù what was happening and helped to the limited extent they could? (In that state, back in the 70?õ????s, regardless of what the law was, unless your parent put you in the hospital or the morgue, the police and prosecutors and didn?õ????t consider it ?õ????child abuse?õ???ù; it was just ?õ????their way of parenting.?õ???ù) Was it my brilliant psychology? My ego that I wouldn?õ????t let get broken?
Who the hell knows. The bottom line is that some kids can survive child abuse and still go on to have meaningful, rich lives, some can on and have some type of good life, some have lives that are terrible, and some fall back into the hell that was their childhood. And other than my advice about finding a good therapist and working with him or her until all the insanity of one?õ????s childhood is worked through, I have no advice for anyone. Sorry.

Since meeting him, I?õ????ve realized how much mistreatment I used to excuse from people who claimed to care about me. I also learned that abuse is not inevitable. People tend to be more devoted to either helping build others up or tearing them down, bit by bit. My husband is one who builds me up.

Worse, after several hours of warming, any fat that dd melt had way too time to combine with proteins to create a mushy-to-tough ?õ????steak substance.?õ???ù It?õ????s become a crutch restaurants use because they can keep it conveniently bagged for hours on end as ?õ????cooked?õ???ù ?õ???? and then quickly sear when the orders come in.
You are under no such constraints.
The best method is to evenly cook the steak by a slow roast, and not so much render the fat completely, but to clarify it and give that melt-in-your-mouth feel. It does not need to reach 129F. But, you probably need a USDA prime cut?õ????.

Do Buddhists believe that you can die and come back as something else in another life?	"There persists to this day many people who claim to be Buddhist and who have obviously followed one of the three primary tenets of Buddhist practice that is STUDY. Any true Buddhist will tell you that one of the primary fundamental teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha is that there is no such thing as reincarnation!
Reincarnation is a Hindu aberration of Brahmanism.
In Buddhism (read Nagarjuna Madhyamika for study), there is the fundamental concept of Impermanence that demonstrates that nothing truly ?õ????exists?õ???ù in the sense that there is no ?õ????thing?õ???ù from atom or particle that is extant eternally. Add to that the teaching of Anatman (once again study Madhyamika), the logical demonstration that there is no permanent repository of the self or soul, and there is no possible way that the human illusion of ?õ????self?õ???ù can or does exist in either illusion or in reality.
Buddhism has three requirements to perform in order to be a correctly practicing Buddhist. Study, a Dedicated mind, and Practice (meditation and following the 8fold path).
In Nichiren Buddhism (contrary to SGI or others who deeply neglect STUDY) is emphatic regarding the practice and STUDY. In this case I again urge any who are interested in the aspect of ?õ????lives?õ???ù to study Nagarjuna. I will also add here the contemporary teachings of Buddhism talk about life as a series of discrete moments of instantiation that occur in succession as our linear experience of a life-time. Moments arise and fall away constantly in Buddhism. Each moment is a birth, and the ensuing moment is a transference of all the karma that instantiated the previous moment. This is the ?õ????evolution?õ???ù of the human condition in karmic manifestation. It is a deeply studied aspect of the 12 linked causal chain (Nidana) and a study of the nature of the process of all life. Birth and rebirth are a provisional device to explain the effort required to modify karma in our human process to awaken our core state of Buddha-hood.

Our personality usually contains many aspects, in which some are dominant, since they could determine which kind of person we could be.

Why is there self-consciousness?	"Self consciousness / self awareness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for intelligence to emerge from a sufficiently complex adaptive system.
Take a complex adaptive system like a brain, sensors, and manipulators. The brain receives signals, the muscles manipulate the environment, and the brain receives and learns from the feedback.
Without the ability for the entity to learn it?õ????s place in space and time, it will never learn simple things like I can move my muscles, I cannot move the wall. This ?õ????consciousness?õ???? of boundaries in space and time *IS* self-consciousness, or self awareness.

If you are in the money, and it's a big garden, you can invest in a automated sprinkler system.

Another option is to have an inverted bottle placed in every pot with a tiny hole in the cap or cap slightly opened. Note that the drip irrigation options will work until the container has water in it.
Technically, most plants (especially succulents) will survive the week as long as they do not get

What is the difference between Devi Maha-Gauri and Devi Shaila-Putri?	"Shail putri means daughter of mountain, first form of nav durga, worshipped on first day of navratri.
Maha gauri means the one who is fair(in colour) and maha is a prefix whish stands for great, but divinely it is supposed to mean one who is purest.
This is difference based on meaning, otherwise they both are same. The nine forms of durga stands for nine different aspects of parvati maa's life, shailputri is the first form as she was born in house of himwan, king of himalaya. Brahmcharini is the form when she left for tapa and did the brahm acharan, ie the most upheld of deeds to appease lord shiva, and so on.
Both the forms are mentioned in detail below:
Shailaputri literally means the daughter (putri) of the mountains (shaila). Variously known as Sati Bhavani, Parvati or Hemavati, the daughter of Hemavana - the king of the Himalayas, she is the first among Navadurgas. Her worship takes place on the first day of

How do I lose thigh fat?	"Check out my blog as well,
Local fat burning is not possible. So the question ""what exercises should I do to burn fat from my legs? I really can not give a good answer. I can tell you that you can
See it: the fat is distributed on your body as energy reserve that just ""is"". It is not active. In contrast muscles are active and burn calories. So if fat is an energy reserve, why the hell just get off your legs if you do a certain exercise?
Perhaps you've also heard that if you train your abs for example, you burn the fat that is around it. Hmm .. That is not quite how it goes in your body.
When you train a muscle, the muscle therefore, a signal is sent to your brains to create hormones that break down fat so it can be used as energy for the workout (even simply put). These hormones are released within seconds freely through your whole body. From there, they break down fat all over your body and let it carry through your bloodstream to the muscles being trained. What ultimately not used, get put back onto the fat parts of your body.
The way we store fat is different for everyone. This has to do with your genes, your gender, your hormones and your lifestyle habits. How one arrives in no time on his / her hips, the other has it back to his / her legs. It is important to understand this; as a leaner legs, this does not mean that you have to follow the exact same workout routines to get the same kind of legs. It is important to focus on your individual metabolism and to understand how and where you store fat quickly and breaks.
Your abdomen, hips, buttocks and thighs are the well known problem areas. And given chemical is to support this because these areas have a higher concentration of alpha-2 adrenoceptor compared with beta-2.
I write a lot and often about your insulin sensitivity as well once this hormone plays a big role in your body when it comes to greasy build / degradation. Initially, sports a very good effect on your muscles and muscle, why? Because the forces your muscles to use carbohydrates and a leg for the fast energy (later proteins for the construction of longer / stronger muscles). As a result there is

What are uncommon early intervention strategies to help children with autism be more sociable?	"You know, one thing that's quite an uncommon strategy is to chill the fuck out.
Autistic kids are developing at their own pace. They will learn and grow much more effectively if they aren't bombarded with and exhausted by every 'strategy' and 'intervention' known to man.
Let them be who they are. Give them opportunities to socialise in a safe *to them* environment, and worry less about them meeting some inapplicable and usually extremely vague standard.
Let your child feel that they are loved and accepted for who they are, and they will blossom in their own way. They may turn out to be an orchid instead of a rose, and that's fine.

Should I be upset that my girlfriend texts guys all day?	"It would seem a lot of posters here are in denial of the existence of cheaters.
Why do people stay in relationships and cheat on the side? I don?õ????t know?õ???? but many many many do.
Maybe a better question to ask yourself is ?õ????how do men and women become friends in the first place?õ????. And I don?õ????t mean an acquaintance?õ???? which today people call a friend. A friend is someone you know, you know them well, you have a steady relationship with, etc?õ???? not someone you chat with at work (colleague), someone you chat with in class (acquaintance)?õ???? they are someone you associate with in your actual personal life.
Men and women begin to associate in each others personal life when one party (or both) has a sexual attraction to the other party. That individual pursues the other in an effort to increase their social status to beyond that of a colleague or acquaintance. So if you do decide that men and women can be strictly platonic real friends?õ???? then just remember that sexual attraction started that friendship in the beginning?õ???? whether or not it ever materialized into sex is another story however.

What do mountain lions eat?	"The North American mountain lion(scientific name is Puma concolor). Opportunistic hunters, mountain lions typically hunt alone from dusk to dawn, taking thier prey (primarily
deer) from behind. On average, a lion will kill a deer every ten to fourteen days. They also dine on coyotes, raccoons, rodents, elk, feral hogs, and even porcupines. Abilities: bound up to 40 feet running- leap 15 feet up a tree- climb over a 12 foot fence- travel many miles at 10mph- reach speeds of 50mph in a sprint. Population numbers are hard to gain, due to the solitary and elusive behavior of the mountain lion, but the best estimate is that they are unlikely to exceed 30,000 in the United States.

Add children and you have a lot more concerns and need more space. I really think the comfortable minimum would be $100,000. You?õ????d have to be in a neighborhood with good public schools. Rent for such a modest place may be $50,000 a year, so there?õ????s the bulk of your earnings. BUT you won?õ????t have all the little expenses associated with home/car ownership. Still, $150,000 would be better.

Which is better in Patna - Aakash or Goal?	"Getting to the topic directly, Aakash would help you out If you know what you're there for. This year, more Faculties are added and It'd probably get better. You'd get served really well in Aakash, asking the same question many times and still not getting to a conclusion? Teachers are there for you any time. They literally teach you the same chapter again if you need to. You'd get free Video Lectures (iTutor) here, all you have to do is to book a seat for it a little bit early. Teachers here put you on the right track and In the end its up to you what you bring out from within.
Now talking about Goal, I've got some friends in Goal and obviously, like you, I ask, Is Goal a better institute in Patna for preparing? Faculties are good out there and helping. You'd get regular tests and assignments also. One thing thats missing is Video lectures In Goal. You can speak up to the teachers about you problem twice or thrice but if you still don't understand the thing, Video Lectures are the best. I don't know much about how the teachers there help out their students but I'm aware of it in Aakash, yes they are absolutely helpful.
This answer would seem a bit in the favor of Aakash, I'm not appreciating Aakash because I'm one of the Aakashians but because I really had a long conversation with my friends about this and this was the conclusion.

Can you feel God? What does God feel like?	"Praise be to Allaah .
[ Allaah : the Arabic name for the One True God ]
.
Proof of the existence of Allah, it is obvious to anyone who ponders the matter, and there is no need for a lengthy discussion. When we ponder the matter, we find that it is divided into three categories: 1- instinctive evidence, 2- tangible evidence and 3 - shar?õ????i (revelatory) evidence . We will explain this to you further, insha Allah.
1- instinctive evidence
Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ?õ????No one is born except upon natural instinct, then his parents turn him into a Jew or Christian or Magian. As an animal produces their young with perfect limbs, do you see anything defective??õ???ù
Abu Huraira said, ?õ????Recite the verse if you wish: Direct your face toward the religion, inclining to truth, the nature of Allah upon which he has created the people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah.?õ???ù (30:30)
This spiritual and rational urge (to believe in Allah) is the strongest factor that prompts man to believe in Allah and affirm His Oneness, because it is usually stronger than any other impulses that may lead man to fall into ignorance and doubt. Often this urge (to believe) may overwhelm a person and make him realise the belief in divine Oneness (Tawheed) deep in his heart at times of crisis and calamity, even if the one who still has that sound natural inclination (fitrah) is pretending today to be an atheist. The call of Tawheed is still urging him from deep inside to believe, because of this natural inclination (fitrah) which is the first covenant taken from the sons of Adam.
2 - tangible evidence
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
?õ????Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators?
Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they have no firm Belief.
Or are with them the treasures of your Lord? Or are they the tyrants with the authority to do as they like??õ???ù[al-Toor 52:35-37]
?õ????So glorify Allaah, when you come up to the evening [i.e., offer the Maghrib (sunset) and ?õ????Isha?õ???? (night) prayers], and when you enter the morning [i.e., offer the Fajr (morning) prayers].
And His is all the praise and thanks in the heavens and the earth, and (glorify Him) in the afternoon [i.e., offer ?õ????Asr (mid-afternoon) prayer] and when you come up to the time when the day begins to decline [i.e., offer the Zuhr (mid-day) prayer].
He brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living. And He revives the earth after its death, and thus shall you be brought out (resurrected).
And among His Signs is this, that He created you (Adam) from dust, and then [Hawwa (Eve) from Adam?õ????s rib, then his offspring from the semen, and], - behold you are human beings scattered!
And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect.
And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of your languages and colours. Verily in that are indeed signs for men of sound knowledge.
And among His Signs is the sleep that you take by night and by day, and your seeking of His Bounty. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who listen.
And among His Signs is that He shows you the lightning, by way of fear and hope, and He sends down water (rain) from the sky, and therewith revives the earth after its death. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who understand.
And among His Signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His Command, then afterwards when He will call you by single call, behold, you will come out from the earth (i.e, from your graves, for reckoning and recompense).
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are obedient to Him.
And He it is Who originates the creation, then will repeat it (after it has perished), and this is easier for Him. His is the highest description (i.e., none has the right to be worshipped but He, and there is nothing comparable unto Him) in the heavens and in the earth. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.?õ???ù[al-Room 30: 17-27]
3 - shar?õ????i (revelatory) evidence
Islam provides answers to the essential fundamental questions which occur to the mind of every intelligent person, those related to the purpose of creation and life, and concerning a further existence after death.
""There is no compulsion in [accepting] religion. The truth has been made distinct from falsehood.""[2:256]
""Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so hasten to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.""[5:48]
Some Evidences that the Qur'aan is the Word of Allaah .
Quran is the religious book of Muslims, it mentioned the following things 1500 years ago:
Origin of the universe: [Quran 21.30] Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the Earth were meshed together then We ripped them apart? And then We made of water everything living? Would they still not believe?
Currently its called big bang theory.
Gaseous state of the early universe: [Quran 41.11] Then He directed himself to the Heaven when it was SMOKE, and then said to it and to Earth: ""Come willingly or by force"" they said ""We do come willingly""
Only confirmed recently!
Expansion of the universe: [Quran 51.47] And the heaven, We built it with craftsmanship and We are still expanding.
Also only recently known!
The end of the universe in a Big crunch scenario: [Quran 21.104] On the day when We will fold the heaven, like the folder compacts the books, and as We originated the first creation We shall return it; a promise (binding on Us); surely We will deliver.
This is one of the possible ending of the universe according to current observation. This was also recently known!
Creation of man from a clinging entity: Created man from a clinging entity. (Quran 96:2)
The Arabic word used here is ?õ????Alaqa?õ???ù which means something that clings or hangs or it can also mean a leech. The human embryo acts and also looks like a leech which is clinging to the uteran wall. Here is a picture:
This was also only recently known.
The light of sun and moon:
It is known that the sun is a star that generates intense heat and light by its internal combustion, and that the moon which does not give off light itself, merely reflects the light received from the sun.
The Qur?õ????an testifies the above fact:
?õ????Blessed is the One Who placed the constellations in heaven and placed in it a lamp (SIRAJ) and a moon, giving light (MUNIIRA)?õ???ù. (25:61)
Here the moon is defined as a body that gives reflection of light (Muniira), while the sun is compared to a blazing lamp or torch (Siraj).
God describes the stages of human development in the womb:
We created man from an essence of clay, then We placed him as a drop of fluid in a safe place, then We made that drop into a clinging form, and We made that form into a lump of flesh, and We made that lump into bones, and We clothed those bones with flesh, and later We made him into other forms ?õ?????õ???? glory be to God, the best of creators! (Quran, 23:12-14)
Bones appearing first and then flesh, only recently known. What comes first in the development of the embryo: bones or flesh?
Role of winds in pollination:
The Qur?õ????an also mentions the role and operation of an important factor in the bringing of things to fruition: the wind.
?õ????We have sent the winds as a means of insemination and impregnation, and then sent down rain from the heavens.?õ???ù (15:22).
How does wind pollinate flowers?
In this verse, the Qur?õ????an unveils another a great mystery of creation, the fundamental role played by the wind in the fertilization of plants.
Difficulty in breathing at higher altitudes:
It is a highly common place reflection on the discomfort experienced at high altitude, which increases the higher one climbs, that is expressed in the Qur?õ????an:
?õ????Those whom God wills to guide, He opens their breast to Islam. While those whom He wills to let straying, He makes their breath closed and constricted, as if they had to climb up the skies?õ???ù. (6:125)
Why does a person face difficulty in breathing at high altitude?
Who informed the Prophet that by climbing up in the skies, the pressure decreases and breathing becomes difficult?
Geological function of mountains:
The Qur?õ????an draws attention to a very important geological function of mountains.
?õ????And We have set on the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with them.?õ???ù [Al-Qur?õ????an 21:31]
As we have noticed, it is stated in the verse that mountains have the function of preventing shocks in the Earth.
This fact was not known by anyone at the time the Qur?õ????an was revealed. It was in fact brought to light only recently as a result of the findings of modern geology.
It used to be thought that mountains were merely protrusions on the face of the earth.
Geologists tell us that the radius of the Earth is about 6,035 km and the crust on which we live is very thin, ranging between 2 to 35 km. Since the crust is thin, it has a high possibility of shaking. Mountains act like stakes or tent pegs that hold the earth?õ????s crust and give it stability. The Qur?õ????an contains exactly such a description:
?õ????Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse, and the mountains as pegs??õ???ù
[Al-Qur?õ????an 78:6-7]
The word awtaad means stakes or pegs (like those used to anchor a tent); they are the deep foundations of geological folds. A book entitled ?õ????Earth?õ???? is regarded as a basic reference textbook on geology in many universities around the world. One of the authors of this book is Dr. Frank Press, who was the President of the Academy of Sciences in the USA for 12 years and was the Science Advisor to former US President Jimmy Carter. In this book, he illustrates the mountain in a wedge-shape and the mountain itself as a small part of the whole, whose root is deeply entrenched in the ground.1 According to Dr. Press, the mountains play an important role in stabilizing the crust of the earth.
These are just a few of the examples of more than 1000 verses out of above 6000 verses of the Quran which speaks about things which science has confirmed recently.
Why did I present all of this? Simple to build my case, If Quran is right about all of this, what are the chances of it being right about the afterlife as well?
Life after death is one of the core topic of Quran:
According to the Quran there are two kinds of lifes, the worldly life ?õ????Ad dunya?õ???ù and the hereafter ?õ????Al Akhira?õ???ù. The frequency of the terms in the Quran is the same, in the case of dunya and akhira- each appears 115 times.
Lost indeed are they who treat it as a falsehood that they must meet Allah,- until on a sudden the hour is on them, and they say: ""Ah! woe unto us that we took no thought of it""; for they bear their burdens on their backs, and evil indeed are the burdens that they bear? And the worldly life is not but amusement and diversion; but the home of the Hereafter is best for those who fear Allah, so will you not reason? Quran 6:31?õ????32
So, after death, our bodies decompose but Indeed there will be life after death, whether anyone likes it or not.
Moreover, try it for yourself, read a sound translation of the Quraan and use your mind to ponder these rules and regulations. There is no doubt that any intelligent person who has the power of discernment will see a great difference between these words (of Allaah) and the words of any person on the face of the earth.
I ask Allaah to guide you to Islam .

Can a person still be affected by a placebo even if they knew it was a placebo?	"Many studies conducted have found that people noticed certain effects resulting from placebos even if the person was told beforehand that it would have no effect and that it wasn't anything more than a sugar pill.
Here are some cases that highlight it
What's more these examples shows the effect of a ?õ????positive mindset?õ???ù but it gets even crazier because the placebo effect can even work on animals like dogs who can associate certain coloured pills with effects and when the chemical responsible for the reaction was subtracted the dogs reacted the exact same way.

Did the Japanese really turn their backs on the Emperor to show respect?	"You?õ????re thinking of European POWs.
Let me back up. To understand the Japanese reverence for their Emperor, you have to understand the Japanese mindset, and their cultural heritage. Only then would you understand why the Japanese, themselves, would never turn their backs on their emperor.
The Emperor of Japan is considered a distant descendant of
I?õ????ll get to your question in a moment, I promise, but let me give you some back story understanding of Shinto belief. Then you can understand why the POWs turned from the Emperor, his son (Akihito, the current Emperor), and why the Japanese would NEVER turn their back to their Emperor.
So?õ????
In many cultures involving multiple gods, the pantheon is shown as flawed so that the followers learn from their mistakes. The gods of many cultures are seen as parents, and you learn from your parents. If dad makes a blunder, you don?õ????t make the same blunder as your dad, right?
But! The SHINTO deities (Shinto means ?õ????Way of the Kami?õ???ù and ?õ????kami?õ???? means ?õ????deity?õ????) is a depiction of what you WANT TO ASPIRE TO BECOME in life.
So, having said that, Amaterasu is the sweetest, most gentle, most loving, most adored picture-perfect goddess you can imagine. When her brother made her cry, she locked herself in the rock cave of heaven, and the sun stopped shining until her brother slew a dragon, pulled a sword from its core, and presented it to her as a gift. And even then, she didn?õ????t come out, because she had too much self respect and dignity to accept charity as an apology (On a semi-related note, Amaterasu came out of hiding because of a beautiful mirror hanging from a tree outside of the cave. After a while, curiosity got to her, because she felt the Yata-no-Kagami mirror was more beautiful than herself. Don?õ????t think she was being vain - she gifted that mirror to the first Emperor of Japan).
So. Under Shinto belief, the bloodline of the Emperor descends from Amaterasu, who is just the sweetest woman to whom you could ever hope to bow.
So, prisoners of war turn their back to Akihito, Emperor of Japan. They do this because of his father, Hirohito (posthumously renamed Emperor Sh???çwa-tenno (tenno being the honorific for an Emperor)).
But Hirohito had an enormous lesson in humility during WW2. Not only did his country have to bow before America, dissolve most of their military, accept America as their military force, and endure his countrymen adopting a ?õ????
He had his top Japanese businessmen learn quality business practices from Doctor Edward Deming, he worked with General MacArthur to restore Japan while preserving Shinto culture. Hirohito became an ally. Hirohito?õ????s Japan became the second largest economy in the world, manufacturing the latest technology trends, and he helped set up Japan?õ????s current constitution during the Vietnam era, where America basically became Japan?õ????s military, which includes bases in places like Yokosuka.
So, while British (and some US) POWs turn their back on Hirohito?õ????s son, Akihito, to show their disgust with Japanese treatment of their POWs during WW2, the truth is, the Japanese people still see their Emperor?õ????s bloodline as divine.
They would never turn their back to their Emperor. Even members of the Yakuza would bow to the Emperor.
Nowadays, Shinto is not practiced heavily as it once was. Only about 3 million people have polled that they are avid and devout Shinto worshippers. But, in a fairly small country, the size of the American west coast, with a population gaining on ALL OF RUSSIA, I can promise you that over a hundred million Japanese KNOW the Shinto stories, even if they don?õ????t WORSHIP those deities the way their ancestors did.
For example, you and I might say that an insane person is ?õ????acting like he was possessed by a demon.?õ???ù But, in Japan, they believe it was a fox spirit, and they beg Inari-no-Kami, the fertility / agriculture god, to release the crazy person. Even now, in modern medicine, the diagnosis of insanity is named for the term of fox spirit possession.
When it rains with the sun out, the term is a ?õ????fox?õ????s wedding.?õ???ù
So, their Shinto culture is SO INGRAINED in their way of living, that they have extra-special reverence for someone like their Emperor.
No, seriously, they REALLY love their Royal family.
So, if you?õ????re defeated in battle, by a samurai, you ask the samurai to take you on as a pupil.
Anyhow?õ????
I would IMAGINE if you told a Japanese person that they turned away just as the Emperor came by, the poor guy (or gal) would be horrified, and feel extremely ashamed.
Shame and honor are enormously defined cultural behaviors over there. If you bring shame to your family, the entire family bares the burden of your shame with you.
Usually, you would stay in your low bow until the Emperor returned the gesture (Where as it would be AWKWARD to stay in a bow too long with anyone else).
So. To understand the Japanese respect for their Emperor is akin to knowing the mindset of the Japanese culture. And, now, you have a better understanding as to why the Japanese love their Emperors.
Hope that helps!

What are the effects of giving raw chicken bones to dogs?	"I put my my dogs on a raw food diet. I have a black lab who is now 13 years old, and when she was 10, she tore her ACL. I was given Tramadol for her, by her vet, but my mom's neighbor told me about the research she had done about using turkey wings?õ???? She explained that feeding those to your dog gave them the most absorbable form of glucosamine and chondroitin. I started feeding her frozen turkey wing chunks 4x a week, and my 10 year old dog, after six months, was bouncing around with no knee pain anymore!
My veterinarian backed this up, and told me that unless you cook the bones, they do not splinter! Therefore, they do not present a choking or puncture hazard.
So, yes, you can give your dog uncooked chicken, just use the same safety protocols you would use in handling raw chicken for yourself. Wash your hands, make sure it's freshly thawed, or you can even give it to them Frozen.

When does a boy become a man?	"He was born with a silver spoon. His grandfather was a landlord of half the village. His dad was a gem of a human being. They had the perfect life. There was one problem though.
His dad had a drinking problem. Things got worse and he did not last long. It was over.
He was 15 when his dad passed away. He locked himself in a room for the next 3 days.
There was nobody to take care of the farms or the cattle. Few months later, the land turned barren and they were soon selling pieces of their property in return for paddy.
His story was a classic riches to rag movie.
He had a mother, a younger sister and a brother to look after. He was still a boy though.
He had one last piece of land left. That was his only option to get back up. He made a decision.
He quit his education when he was in his 10th grade. He took up farming though he didn't have the faintest idea about it.
He worked with his mother day in and day out. He ploughed the field though it was something a 15 year old, born with riches couldn't imagine doing. Then he started working for other people for the next 3 years.
That eighteen year old kid was the man of the house. He did not stop there.
He made his sister and his brother complete their basic education.
He took care of the cattle, worked his ass off at the farm and by the age of 24 he had bought back most of his land.
He then stood by and found another gem for his sister. He went on to the next level and bought his ancestral house which they had mortgaged.
10 years later, that boy who weeped hard in the corner of the room when his dad left them, was now a proud man.

Meditation can be upon the image of Lord you love, or it can be just to calm your mind and free your thoughts for some time.
Sometimes, if you practice meditation with eyes closed, you might see a light upon your forehead , as long as there is light , there is sunyata. It means your heart is pure, and you are one of those persons on earth , whom God loves. Moreover, you are a kind of person who would never even lie, or hurt anyone .

What is the most British thing ever?	"I heard somebody say that it is the shipping forecast,
Britain is made up of a number of islands and the obsession with the weather is well known,so all forecasts are important but despite all of the modern technology available to mariners the Shipping forecast continues to be broadcast by the BBC on its Radio 4 (news and spoken word programmes) station each evening at 17.54 just before the prime time daily news update at 18h00,
Thus we have many thousands of people tuned in listening to storm warnings for Fisher, Dogger, German Bight and Portland Bill etc whilst driving around city centres or standing cooking their teas, all knowing that this weather forecast is not really for them but that it might allow a ship heading into danger to take appropriate evasive action, And we still listen in awe!

Which phone is better than the OnePlus 3T?	"Are you seriously thinking of upgrading, after using a OnePlus 3?
If I were you, I would wait till the next phones are released around May-June and then make a decision. Upgrading from OP3 to OP3T is not recommended, if you ask me.
But if you are decided to go for an upgrade, then OP3T is the only phone out there within 30K that can be considered as an upgrade :)
Edit: Just now re-read the question again. Since you are giving your OP3 to your brother and lookin to purchase a new phone for yourself, why don't you buy a mid-ranger like the Moto G3 Turbo or similar and wait till the new devices come out? If you already decided to purchase a good phone now itself, then OP3 is the best choice.

Does Kali Linux increase net speed?	"Yes, you can assume that it increases your internet speed. Depends on the perspective of the person and also on what are you comparing it with. If you are shooting this statement with respect to Windows then the answer is yes. When you are using windows, it has several small instances of programs/ softwares that may be sucking up on your internet by running in background.
Just for an example: Windows update manager constantly checks for updates and downloads those updates in background itself. This is not the case of Linux , it doesn't hog the system resources by running extra softwares in BG. Windows is dedicated to user experience whereas linux has made no such commitment. If you want to perform the basic updates, then you can do so by inserting a few commands in terminal manually.
So, basically the reality is, switching from Windows to Linux gives you this illusion of increased internet speed. You can use alternatives for segmentation tools (such as IDM) in Linux (XDM, flareget etc.) to increase downloading speed but your?õ???? internet speed won't increase as such. Definitely Kali has nothing to do with it, it's totally dependent on your ISP.

Have you ever witnessed a murder?	"I've been joint first on scene to a couple, one where the victim had not quite died yet.
Both were stabbings and both were in leafy North East Cambridgeshire
One was a call late at night to a flat above some shops. The offender had ambushed and murdered his girlfriend in their flat, then tried (and failed) to kill himself. When that didn't work he bottled out and called police for help.
We got in and it was like a scene from one of those hammy horror films where they use far too much fake blood - it was everywhere. He was sat cross legged on the floor with his knife - he could stand because he had tried to cut open his Femoral Arteries via his inner thighs.
She was upstairs under a bedsheet, very dead, I can still picture seeing her head half sawn off.
The other was a Lithuanian chap that had been stabbed in the arse by his housemate. Apparently it is major insult to get stabbed in the arse. They had argued over which one was going to pay for the vodka and he lost. It wasn't an intentional murder, but the attacker got it wrong and sliced through his Femoral artery and he bled out in minutes. I arrived just as the ambulance crew were literally sprinting out the front door with the patient. I got a look at his face and could see straight away he was staring into that tunnel of light.
As for actually being an eyewitness to the act and the death - no, that is quite rare for anybody. A street fight gone wrong maybe, or a targeted assassination.
Often the victim doesn't show signs of imminent death fro some time.
We had another murder a few years ago, a local drug user had been stabbed by the new boyfriend of his ex-partner (they treid to demonstrate that she had set him up for it but couldn't secure the evidence). When police arrived, the victim was walking around grumpily complaining that he wanted to retrieve his clothes. An ambulance was called and he begrudgingly got in and went off to hospital while the incident initially appeared to be a minor scuffle. We got a call from the hospital a few hours later suggesting we should get there as he was now on life support and not expected to last the night - he didn't - single stab wound to the liver I think. He didn't even have any blood on his shirt when he went off to hospital, all the damage was internal.
I've just realised that in writing this, I have painted the Fens area that I work as a knife crazy stabathon zone. It's not, there was a good gap between each of these

Did I do a good thing that I broke up with my girlfriend?	"From the details:
Mainly because I took an aproach of trying to explain her with a cold head at first but as I had to mention it more often we?õ????ve eventualy got in to arguments and started shouting at each other and even after some really loud arguments she wasn?õ????t able to fulfil her duties.
Yes, you did a bad thing. Several bad things, in fact, including assuming that it was her ?õ????duty?õ???ù to be your maid and housekeeper merely because she?õ????s a woman who?õ????s dating you.
I can understand the shouting matches. Are you looking for a partner or a servant?

Why do people say that emotions show that human consciousness is more than just a logical machine?	"James Grier Miller has one of the more fascinating theories I?õ????ve read lately on ?õ????Living Systems.?õ???ù Miller contends

That being said, when you ask about emotion showing we are not machines, I think what you are referring to is the representation of emotion and/or sensation in the mind called ?õ????qualia.?õ???ù Qualia do challenge the foundational assumption of materialism: the idea that everything is physical and the idea that everything is determined. This is because the existence of

It is important to note that intentionality as referred to in this discussion is more than intent alone.
When we consider words, sentences, pictures in the mind, we see they do not have intentionality inherently in and of themselves alone.

Arguments about ALL of this go back as far as Plato and Aristotle. The Philosophy of Mind has grown up around these questions in our modern day because, even after all this time, the questions posed are not readily or easily, or so far, fully resolved.

What are 12 bar blues?	"I'll add that the 12 bar form is based on 3 4 bar segments.?ˇ Blues lyrics usually repeat the first line of the verse even have a 3 line to conclude the verse.?ˇ This corresponds to the 3 4 bar sections.
Usually the final 4 bars is called the ""turnaround"", and functionally sets the progression up to repeat.?ˇ Most often this is done by starting and ending this 4 bar section on the 5 chord, and one of the simplest turnarounds is V-IV-I-V
there are a lot of variations to the form, and others have provided some basic exampleS. I'll point out a few pop tunes (one a bit obscure)...
""Give Me One Reason"" by Tracy Chapman is a twelve bar form that borders on ""bare necessities"".?ˇ It's really just a 1-4-5 adapted to a 12 bar cadenc.
""Stormy Monday"" whoever plays it.?ˇ This is a far more advanced 12 bar, throwing in some minor 2nd root movement and some nice modulations, and never properly resolves the 5th (the V chord is an augmente).
and the obscure tube is ""Someone Else's Blues"" by David Bromberg.?ˇ It's a fairly slow 12/8, and to some may seem to be a 24 bar pattern.?ˇ It seems to compress its turn around to only 2 bars.

It's not fair for the school because they allocated resources for you and expect payment, and it's not fair for the other students that may have wanted to take the class but couldn't because the class was full.
Many schools let you drop without penalties if you do it within the first or second weeks.

How did you succeed on Etsy?	"Hi there is a few basics to etsy. One is research, you have understand how to properly use all its benefits such as paid listings (these work) and content writing. Look up your competition, see how much detail and work they put into their descriptions. People have many questions and your page should answer it in detail.
A product i looked at was a jar, i can guarantee that if you look up mason jars and someone had the same item they wrote a book on it. We can all see how beuatiful the jar is but the more text you have the better Etsy search can understand what your page is about and entice them to buy it. Also how long does it take to ship? Is it made to order? Can i get a custom name on it? Do you show different angles? Possibly show it with liquid inside and in a bathroom? Its all about selling. What is the size? Another important thing is ambiance, it shouldnt look like you just snapped a photo at a random spot, some people spend money buying props and photographers to improve the look. I know this makes a big deal for people, people on etsy love rustic feel, you do wood work. Put it on a wooden piece in the grass some where or on a wooden shelf with a towel next to it.
Look at this persons listing and compare to yours. Dont get me wrong, it doesnt always come down to all the ?õ????fluff?õ???ù as i have seen some empty pages make lots of sales. These are just tips that i have found that work. I think what really worked for us is momentum, when it sells once there tends to have others follow.

How can I make my thinking extremely logical?	"A2A. Train your mind.
The brain, much like a muscle, needs to be exercised and molded to reach its full potential. Although, we'll never truly realise it's ?õ????full?õ???ù potential, seeing as the human brain is quite a marvel, one which we still don't fully understand, nor will we ever be able to.
Play games which force you to think logically. Sudoku and stuff like that. I'm sure Google will give you many more suggestions in this regard.
Ultimately, it all comes down to genetics and sometimes, we simply lack the ability to be any more logical than our capacity permits. You could enhance your logical ability to some degree, but there's a certain level you'll never be able to exceed. We can only realise that potential which is within our capacity to achieve.
Also, keep the company of logical people. If you hand around with idiots, you'll become more idiotic. Hang around with intelligent, logical thinkers, and you too will become more logical.
Unfortunately, logic is something which can't simply be taught. We have to make do with what God has given us and try to maximise what's in our potential to maximise.
Also, free your mind. Give up all forms of brainwashing and mind control, such as music, tv, etc.
If you watch junky stuff, you'll develop a junky mind and it will diminish your logical ability. But if you stimulate yourself with more wholesome, less trivial material, odds are, it will enhance your logical ability.
The kinda food you eat makes a difference too. Eat junk, be junk. Eat healthy, be healthy. Eat foods rich in vitamins and minerals essential for maintaining a healthy brain. An omega 3 supplement could also prove to be quite effective. Again, Google should enlighten you a lot more than I can, in this regard.
Logic is directly related to intelligence, so this is a vast topic and there is no simple answer to your question. There are simply too many factors at play here.
But in a nutshell, my advice is, live a good, wholesome, healthy life; eat right, sleep right, avoid things which are detrimental to your health, both in a mental and physical sense, don't let your mind idle for too long and continuously stimulate it with tasks conducive to enhancing logical thinking.
Also, just taking a break away from the mundane ?õ????concrete jungle?õ???ù lifestyle we're so engrossed in, could work wonders. Head out to the mountains or somewhere the like thereof, every so often. Somewhere away from the city where you can actually see the stars and get connected with the natural world again. You'll be surprised what a huge effect it will have on your psyche.
There's honestly too much to this, but hope that my answer satisfactorily addresses your question to some degree.
Ps. Now you might find this hard to believe, but if you really want a guaranteed way to get smarter and think more logically?õ????
Get spiritual. Yes, that's right.
God controls everything! Whatever you want, turn to Him. Again, too vast to get into all this, but just take my word for it. The ultimate solution is to ask God to make you extremely logical.
Also, learn the Arabic language. Specifically, the Quranic Arabic. I promise you, it will make you smarter and thereby enhance your logical ability.

Can Allah be the prophet of Lord Krishna?	"Allah means God, God comes to this world in human form like Krishna, Rama, Jesus, Holy Mohammad etc to preach divine knowledge. Their outer look only differed but essentially the divine knowledge is one and the same. Krishna preached that God comes to this world in human form and to identify Him when comes here and serve Him (path of Nivrutti). Jesus touched both Pravrutti (justice) as well as Nivrutti. Rama & Mohammad concentrated on Pravrutti to establish justice in the society.
Krishna gave two statements in the Gita. The first statement is that He is unimaginable because nobody can know Him (Maam tu veda na kashchana ?õ????). The second statement is that He entered a human body (manushim tanumaashritam ?õ????). These statements together give the total concept of God. God is beyond spatial dimensions and hence, He is beyond imagination. In order to preach the spiritual knowledge, to give the correct direction to the humanity, He comes down to the world of human beings by entering a human body (a particular deserving devotee existing at that point of time, also called as ?õ????Son of God?õ????).
The human body means a human being. The inert material body associated with inert energy consisting of awareness with different feelings (jeeva) is the human body. Human body does not mean mere inert body containing inert matter and inert energy only. Such a body cannot be even a living body due to absence of life. If you say living body, it may mean the body of a bird or an animal also. Such living body cannot deliver the knowledge to the human beings.
The original absolute God is unimaginable due to absence of spatial dimensions in Him. God is the generator of space, which means the spatial dimensions are absent in God. Space should be totally absent before its generation.
The departed human souls also come under this category. The energetic body of God is quite relevant to the souls existing in similar energetic bodies. In the same way, the same unimaginable God charges a human body in this world for the sake of the souls existing in materialized human bodies. Thus, the human incarnation of God is quite relevant to the human beings in this world.
The primary program of God in the incarnation is to guide the souls in correct path in pravrutti as well in nivrutti. Such direct interaction is not possible between two irrelevant dissimilar bodies.

What are some themes for a fashion show?	"A fashion show is an ensemble of creative ideas, right from ramp, lighting, and d?ü??cor, to models and clothing. Success of a fashion show depends on whether it is able to spark the imagination of audience, and convince them to buy those clothes. Themes in fashion shows, are able to do just that, as they provide theatrics and create drama, at an otherwise normal show.
Theme of a fashion show should be in tangent with the purpose of the show, and it should be interesting and captivating for the audience. The purpose can be fundraising for charity, a designer promoting his collection, entertainment for some other event, etc, and the theme should be along the same lines. Following are some themes, which can be used in a fashion shows:
Trends of different decades
This is one of the most popular theme and is as evergreen as the eras gone by. Clothes inspired from the 60?õ????s, 70?õ????s, 80?õ????s and 90?õ????s can be showcased in this theme. Some good examples of these clothes, are bright colored skintight clothes from 1980?õ????s, and bell bottom pants of 1970?õ????s.
Seasonal theme
Again a very popular theme, as fashion shows are generally showcased as fall/winter collection or summer/spring collection. Dark colors like grey and black for winters, and pale colors like pink, peaches, yellow, lemon green, etc, can be used for summer. Summer/spring clothes can include tank tops, shorts, skirts, dresses, raincoats and boots, and winter collection can have sweaters, coats and sweatshirts.
Goth or Punk theme
This theme involves dark colors like purple, black and red, loud music and models wearing heavy makeup and attitude. A punk band as entertainment, will add to the theme. Fabric choices in this fashion show can be leather, animal prints, plaids, fishnets and fake fur.

Clothes for specific audience
This theme can showcase clothes, which are made for certain section of people, like maternity clothes, kids clothing, clothes for wedding, etc.
Bollywood theme
Bollywood sets trends in India and internationally, so this is an ideal theme for a fashion show. The show can have glamorous, colorful, Indian ethnic clothes (maybe from some of the hit Bollywood movies). The way models catwalk can have some drama or it can be choreographed like a musical extravaganza, just like Bollywood movies.
Crazy and unconventional theme
Striking clothes can be used, with bold colors such as bright red, orange, green, etc, with unconventional make up on models. This theme can be great fun to put together and a designer can go wild with ideas, on this one.
Accessories as theme of the show
Accessories are an important part of dressing. This theme can be used to present accessories like handbags, belts, scarves, bracelets, etc.
High fashion theme
Runway fashion which are trend setting and unique, can be showcased in this theme. Inspiration for clothes can be taken from haute couture designer outfits. These clothes are made with high quality material and are high in cost. Hair and makeup of models should be suitably matching the designer clothes.
Theme with handcrafted items
Handicrafts such as jute, meenakari or tarakashi, woven or embroidered handicrafts, such as bandhanis, etc, can bring an ethnic feel to the show. Woven or handcrafted clothes, designed in couture style, can look very chic.
Classic books theme
Classics are a great source of inspiration for designers. Theme of the show can be inspired by classics like, ?õ????Alice in Wonderland?õ????, ?õ????Gone with the wind?õ????, ?õ????Romeo and Juliet?õ????, etc.
To conclude, a nice well thought theme, with good music and sound effects, can take the designs being presented at a fashion show, to the next level. Hope these ideas are enough to get you started, in organizing a wonderful show. All the best!

Could a white man murder a black man and get away with it in the southern states in the 1960s in the U.S.A?	"It has been reported many times. Black men were hanged from trees for the slightest offences or simply for sport. Black women were raped and beaten by white men as were their children. Young boys were killed for sport.
In some cases there would be a pretense of an investigation but rarely did anyone get convicted.
That is ONE link to ONE particularly well publicized lynching of a young boy. It came to the notice of the general population and to the world when the boy?õ????s mother had an open casket at his funeral so everyone could see what white men had done to her 14 year old boy.

What is the difference between a 10 holes and a 20 holes harmonica?	"A 10 hole harmonica (or 'harp') is your standard diatonic. It's tuned in such a way that it repeats the same sequence of notes through three octaves when blowing, for example CEGCEGCEGC for holes 1-10. This is called Richter tuning. The draw notes of these are laid out rather strangely, but a major scale is achieveable by playing the second octave (holes 4-7) in sequence.
However, a 20 hole harp is what's called a tremolo. These have four or more octaves and are tuned to the major scale, meaning that the same sequence of notes repeats three or four times along the length of the harp.

"Two similar ways to tie the shoelaces. One of them is stronger, how do you tell them apart and what is the reason (why stronger or weaker)?"	"I?õ????ve never seen anyone claim that one is stronger than the other; there are other reasons to favor it. But hey, I guess it could be true. One way looks better than the other, which is why most people switch.
When most people tie their shoes, the resulting loops tend to cant at an angle across the shoe. No matter how often you pull the loops to the sides, they don?õ????t stay there. It doesn?õ????t look good.
The alternative method gives you loops that lie perfectly horizontal, and *stay* horizontal, like a little bow tie. It looks much better and I?õ????m told there?õ????s less chance of it catching on something and coming untied.
Meanwhile, this video makes it sound pretty complicated?õ????here?õ????s the easy method:
Start to tie your shoe like you normally do. When you get to the point where you are about to wrap the free end over the the top of the loop, go under instead, and come back over the top. This will alter how it tucks into the bow, but that will come naturally to you and requires no explanation.
Basically, you are reversing the direction that you wrap the cord around the loop, from whichever way you do it naturally.
That?õ????s it. Pull it tight and you will have a beautiful horizontal bow that all will admire. Theoretically it?õ????s less likely to come out than the other method.
There is a third method, by which you start with the usual half knot, then take up a loop on each side and knot them like they were cord ends, into another half knot. If you arrange the direction of your knots properly, you?õ????ll wind up with a square knot structure, which is pretty strong. Even if you go the other way it works. It?õ????s a good technique for kids who have trouble with the usual methods, because it?õ????s easy to see and understand what you are doing, and some people with dexterity issues find it easier than the traditional method. I have also been told it?õ????s *much* less likely to come loose on its own than the ?õ????wrap and tuck?õ???ù method.
Have fun experimenting!

How do hotels get compensated from guests who pay with points?	"Most franchise hotels get compensated by their central office at the end of the month in their franchise statement.

In some franchises the credit for points can even count towards the franchise fee and other central office charges.

Is education really necessary to get successful in life?	"According to Oxford Dictionary education means the process of receiving or giving systematic instruction, especially at a school or university. I will be considering this defination for my answer.
Education is important?õ????there?õ????s no denying that fact. For the most part, the more schooling you receive, the more successful you will be in your chosen path. In general, people who drop out or receive minimal education are probably headed toward a long, torturous career slinging burgers at a fast food joint. That?õ????s the common perception, at least. But here are ten famously successful people who stand as exceptions to the rule:
Before becoming possibly the richest man in history (taking inflation into account), John Rockefeller was the lowly son of a dodgy con artist and high-school student in suburban Cleveland, Ohio. Although he had some education, by the time he was sixteen, Rockefeller decided it was
It?õ????s pretty safe to say that he accomplished that mission and then some. Rockefeller made his mark in the oil industry, starting Standard Oil and ultimately creating a monopoly on the entire industry. By 1902, Rockefeller was worth $200 million, and before his death he would amass a fortune of more than one billion dollars. And high school was supposed to be important. . . .
2. Steve Jobs
Apple Co-Founder
There have been many great thinkers of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and some of them have done incredible things without ever having finished college. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg spring to mind. But perhaps the most influential technological mind of the past century has been Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple.
Jobs and Steve Wozniak created the first successful personal computers, and over the years helped introduce numerous revolutionary products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. And Jobs did this after
Incidentally, Jobs was adopted, and the stipulation set forth by his birth mother only agreed to give him up to Paul and Clara Jobs when they agreed that they would make sure he attended college. Well, mission partly accomplished.

Instead, Ford left home at the age of seventeen and became an apprentice with a machinist in Detroit?õ????a career path he would ultimately take to another level on his way to becoming a wildly rich and successful industrialist. Despite having next to no real education, Ford created the mechanized assembly line?õ????and it wasn?õ????t long before Detroit gained the nickname of the Motor City because of his incredible work.
4.Winston Churchill
Statesman and War Leader
One of the most towering political figures of the twentieth century, a famous wit?õ????and, frankly, a quote machine?õ????Winston Churchill was born into aristocracy. It should therefore come as no surprise that he rose through the ranks to eventually lead the United Kingdom to victory during World War II. What probably does come as a surprise?õ????or at least would, if he wasn?õ????t included on a list with this title?õ????is that he achieved this with a limited education.
Churchill, coming from such a good family, was given access to the best education available. That didn?õ????t mean he was any good at it, of course. Churchill
5.Abraham Lincoln
US President
Perhaps the most popular US president in history, and a guy who, contrary to popular belief, did not fight vampires, Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth man to lead the USA. He guided the nation through perhaps its most troubling time. But the man who made the Gettysburg Address and effectively ended slavery in the USA?õ????though not through his crippled

Einstein eventually made it into college and earned a degree, of course, because men of his staggering intellect always find a way in the end. But the simple fact of the matter is that the greatest mind of the twentieth century was in fact a high school dropout.

Is Messi's 4 match ban appropriate?	"I am writing this answer trying not to be biased at all. Messi may and may not have deserved the ban, but under what circumstances?
The ref did not hear anything such during the match, none such action was taken during the match by the referee. Even if he did, no in match action took place then. Post match the referee denied any such claims too. Up till now, it was undeserving.
Later FIFA released the statement just 5 hours before the kick-off match of Argentina vs. Bolivia. Knowing the naive situation of Argentina, this was easily looking as a deliberate hurdle for the Argentina NT and Leo Messi in the way of WC-Russia-2018.
Coming to deserving or non deserving, I have been watching football for over a decade now and have seen worse incidences than this that have gone cheaply or without any punishment. Humiliating chants and verbal conversation is very common in EPL, none has been punished strictly, let alone 4 WCQ matches. Their have been worse physical battles and personal issues people have done that have gone unnoticed. The point that FIFA specifically took keen interest in pointing this out and handing a 4 match ban is fishy to any one with common sense. Even after headbutting a player Zizou got a 3 match ban, while Leo got a 4 match ban for an incident that was neither seen nor reported.
Messi is one of the calmest players on the ball and on the pitch, rarely getting physical or verbal with anyone. Everyone knows how Chile or any other team that is unable to contain Messi deals with him. If he would have done anything such it would?õ????ve been under harshest circumstances, and is totally appropriate to be deemed as wrong but not a 4 match ban.

Does the idea of Heaven sound boring after a while to anyone else?	"Here is a paste of my answer to this same question a few days ago:
It has been my observation that the conceptions that people harbor about Heaven, God, etc. are extremely limited. These ideas demonstrate the shallowness and poverty of the imagination and the cheap, cartoon concepts of Heaven that have rushed in to fill the imaginative void.
Copied from the great mythologist Joseph Campbell, here is my atheist?õ????s idea of what heaven would have to be like if such a thing existed, which is does not.
The definition of
Similarly, the definition of
Heaven is timeless, eternal. That means there are no events. It is not a place or an event, never mind a series of events. Instead, Heaven is a ?õ????state of being.?õ???ù
According to Campbell, the ?õ????state of being?õ???ù that constitutes Heaven is
There is only one state in Heaven ?õ???? eternal unmodulated
Boredom is logically impossible; there is only
Campbell said: ?õ????I came to this idea of bliss because in Sanskrit, which is the great spiritual language of the world, there are three terms that represent the brink, the jumping-off place to the ocean of transcendence:
I have always felt offended by this prospect (just like the idea of Eden is offensive.) In the same way that sperm cells are helplessly compelled to stick to the ovum by their heads, disembodied humans would be helplessly compelled to stick by our heads to the infinite glory of God, waving our feet like the tails of feeding tadpoles, our consciousness extinguished by overwhelming and transcendent bliss.
I think this state of being is, like Eden, unworthy of humans. Not that I?õ????d even be able to think that if I were there. All I?õ????d be able to feel would be bliss. And that?õ????s what I mean by ?õ????unworthy.?õ???ù

Why is the govt. of India erasing an important part of India's grand regional history by merging the SBI with its associate banks?	"India is big country with second largest population and 7th largest GDP. But no Indian bank is in top 50 banks in world in balance sheet size.
What is the need of banks with large balance sheets?
When ever there is a need for a major projects banks are unable to lend as their balance sheet is large enough. This causes splitting of loans with multiple banks, which is not a favourable option for the entities.
The combined entity will have a balance sheet of 37 trillion placing it at 45th place.
There are large number of PSU banks that run inefficiently and require regular influx of funds from taxpayers money. Merger is the best way to optimise resources and reduce the costs and improve the efficiency. This will help in reducing government intervention saving tax payers money.
The regional culture is not relevant in banking system anymore becuase all the banks are now computerised and having branches in many places in the country.
The state bank group still reminds us the presence of princely states in India,which no longer exists. Even the states are restructured and renamed. So we may have to move on with the banking system too.

Why do New Jersey college-bound high school students who want to attend a large university prefer not to go to Rutgers?	"I don't find that to be true at all. In my graduating class, we had scores of kids go to Rutgers. Easily the most common. I went to William Paterson (another NJ state school) and I could count on my hands the classmates who went too. For those who wanted to be ~further away~ we had a lot of kids go to schools in VA, CT, DE, etc.

What are the disadvantages and advantages of becoming an IAS?	"I think everyone knows about the advantages. Let's go straight forward to the disadvantages.
> No time : you will have to work hard. You will find very less time for your family, friends & for your hobbies.
> You will be seen as corrupt (*typical mindset of nearly all the people).
> You might have to work under political leaders whom you may not find worth following orders from.
> Even your small mistake can bring you into limelight negatively. So, you have to be very alert and careful when in public & otherwise too.
> People will judge you. It is what most of us afraid of.
> If you are committed & was very clear on why you wanted to become an IAS then you will have to work for 24?ü??7 which means you will need to make many sacrifices. You cannot be lazy. You will have to be proactive.
(One of the top regrets in life as per research is ?õ????why I worked very hard in life??õ???ù so the reason why you worked hard as an IAS is if anything other than the satisfaction you get from your work can become a reason for a regret in life).

What are the best ways to promote my Android App on the Google Play market to achieve more installs?	"To answer your question, we need to first know how App ranking is decided. Google has, indeed, adopted a very sophisticated system in determining the ranking of an App for a keyword. The criteria taken into account are listed as follows:
(1) Number of Installs
(2) Retention Rate (how many days an App stays installed on a device?)
(3) Rating (out of 5.0) and number of ratings and reviews).
(4) Number of backlinks to your App's Google Play page.
The most important criteria is (1), it weights about 60-70% in determining ranking, therefore, your main task is to get as many installs as possible in a short period of time.
The next question is, how to get installs. There are many ways:
(1) Improve your App's quality. It could be done by making your game bug-free, hiring an expert artist to improve your game's graphic quality, etc. With good game quality, you get higher ratings and players are more willing to download your App when they visit your App's page.
(2) Cost-per-install campaigns. You can purchase a large amount of installs to boost your App's ranking on Google Play. It is actually essential as there is no better ways to acquire visibility to your App (imagine if you choose to spend tens of thousands of dollars on billboard, TV or newspaper adverts, how many downloads do you think those methods can bring to you?)
Out of all providers, I genuinely recommend
As a personal experiment, I have obtained 40 Australian installs for a game with app2top and it successfully got charted in Australia for 8 days! You may try with your App too! (but of course, if you aim for UK/US, you need much more installs to have the same effect)
(3) App Store Optimization. It can be done by making a good looking icon for your App, including good looking screenshots, and a good description with good keywords included. Good keywords can be found on
(4) To increase the number of backlinks to your App's Google Play page, I suggest you to post your App onto as many forums as possible. Join a few facebook app developers group and share your link with other developers so earn a few more downloads.
I hope my advice may help you, wish you a success with your App.

Is it safe to strap something to your body and then go skydiving?	"It depends. An experienced skydiver should be capable of making that determination based on the snag hazards and drag characteristics of the object. It?õ????s generally not a good idea to attach something to yourself unless its a tested, secured system like a smoke canister or flag. Even then, these items have quick release mechanisms so that you can free yourself from a snag or entanglement situation, and there is no substitute for qualified instruction.
On rare occasions, some friends and I jump with one of these. It?õ????s nearly 4 feet long and creates a lot of drag. Trying to ride it like a horse will cause you to tip upside down if you can even hold on at all. The best body position for deployment is belly-to-earth, so you?õ????ll want to let go before pull time.
Throw in a bunch of inflatable animals and a Short SC.7 Skyvan (with rear tailgate), and you?õ????ve got yourself a proper zoo dive:

What in your life has almost scared you to death?	"This beautiful creature which is eternal part of my life scared me to death :
Yes ! A House Lizard Scared Me To Death Today.. :-(
I know getting scared of lizards is considered to be ?õ????A Typical Girl Thing?õ????.
But let me clarify that I'm only and only afraid of the reptiles (all of them). And lizards and I have a weird kind of connection, I just love to hate lizards.
So the whole scary episode went like this :
I entered my room and there it was, lying on a the floor very nicely ! I was a little scared by then but yeah, it was under control.
The significance of spotting a lizard in the house after so many months popped into my mind. Yayyyy!!!!! Summers !!! I was happy as I really hate winter season.
And even though I hate lizards from all of my heart still today, I was happy to see one. So I just thought of acknowledging it (obviously from some distance) with some kind words :D
And I was like :
And finally I just ran away. I ran away as far as I could. Like this :
Being successful in running out of its territory was such a relief !!
All images are taken from Google
?õ????And hereby I would like to say that never in my life again,will I offer such an overwhelming acknowledgement to a lizard, or any creature so that it starts feeling the urge to hug me.?õ???ù

Have your ever changed someones opinion of your nationality when you traveled?	"No. Whenever I've travelled, I've never changed someone's opinion about my nationality because I'm an Indian and I look and behave very very much like one.
But coming to your question, I've to my surprise and awe, seen a man who was a co-passenger in the Darjeeling Mail we were travelling in have a totally different opinion of where my brother hails from. We are Banerjees. Pakka Bengalis. 'Ghotis', to be precise. And we are also from Kolkata.
While we were travelling to New Jalpaiguri to further head to Darjeeling, suddenly a man came up to us, possibly floored by my baby brother's overwhelming cuteness. He shook the tiny thing's little hands and gently asked him 'Aapni ki odikkar, Moshai??õ???? (Translation: Are you from the region you're travelling to, Mister??õ????)
The man thought my brother was either a Nepalese or a Sikkimese!!! That's probably because of those bright little baby eyes and wonderful dark black pupils he had back then! And those cherry-red bulging cheeks!!
P.S. Currently couldn't upload his childhood picture sorry, but believe me, it's coming soon!

How could I know if a sniper is aiming at me? And if I saw him how could I save myself?	"Everyone?õ????s been pretty clear on answering that you wouldn?õ????t know. And for the most part, they?õ????re right. But I?õ????m going to give you a more generous scenario to consider. One where you could tell, see him, and save yourself. It does happen.
You?õ????re walking patrol with your squad. Its early evening, getting dark, but you can still see without night vision. Lets say, you?õ????re in a small town or large village. The locals are not friendly, but not openly hostile. So you?õ????re alert and looking around. You enter into a traffic circle, with a bit of a garden in the middle.
From out of the corner of your eye, you see a flash, the pointman drops to the ground in a spray of blood, and then you hear a rifle shot.
The first thing you do is sprint to cover as the rest of your squad does the same. You want something solid between you and Mr. Sniper. Most of you end up behind the stonework in the traffic circle. Pvt Slow his behind the road curb, because that?õ????s all he could find.
Immediately afterward, your squad-mates start asking did anybody see where the shot came from. Everyone is getting as close to Mamma Earth as they can. Sergeant is on the radio requesting mortar support. Corporal and Pvt Near at Hand dart forward to grab Pvt Point and drag him behind cover to administer aid. There?õ????s a bang, and Pvt Near at Hand?õ????s canteen erupts in a mini-geyser. He pees himself in fear, but keeps dragging Pvt Point.
You remember that flash you think you saw. You peek your eye around the whatever you?õ????re hiding behind, careful not to rise up or expose yourself any more than absolutely necessary, and see a building you think is in the area where the flash might have been. You slide back behind cover and yell to your squad, pointing and describing the building. Half the squad tries to cover the area in case of close ambush, while the rest try to get a look at the building without exposing themselves. You happen to be looking right at the building when you see another flash, and Pvt Obvious slumps to the ground. There?õ????s a little hole in his forehead, but the back of his head looks like a smashed watermelon.
You know right where the sniper is, or was a moment ago. Maybe its the same spot where he took his first shot, maybe not. ?õ????Third floor, second window from the right!?õ???ù you shout. Sergeant orders suppressing fire. The building is right at the edge of the effective range of your carbines. Maybe you?õ????re hitting it, maybe not. The LMG probably is.
There?õ????s another flash, from a different window, and Pfc LMG slumps down. Pvt Asst LMG gets on the gun to keep up the fire.
Sergeant is informed that here will be no fire mission, too high a risk of civilian casualties. The rest of the Platoon is inbound, but several minutes away.
Sergeant tells everyone to get ready to move, back towards where you came from. He orders Pvt Slow to be ready to provide covering fire. On Sergeant?õ????s order, two guys pop smoke. After a few seconds, the cloud is dense enough to move. The squad leapfrogs, providing covering fire. They move slowly, as they are carrying the wounded and dead.
You are part of the last element to move. While being covered by your squad, you dash across the traffic circle back to the road. You feel a punch in the ass, stumble, but keep going, not sure what happened, but not willing to stop and find out.
Once with your squad, Pvt Chuckles informs you that you?õ????ve been shot in the ass, and starts laughing. That punch you felt was a round grazing your butt cheek. Sergeant orders the squad to maneuver on the sniper?õ????s hide, being careful to stay out of the line of fire. By the time you get there, Mr. Sniper is long gone. He?õ????s even policed up his brass.
On your own, you?õ????re fucked, unless Mr. Sniper is inept.

What are the best high-quality bicycle brands?	"If you want something that is a mix of speed and roughness then go for a hybrid bike. This bike can go faster than a mountain bike in a flat smooth road and can also ride through rough pavements which the road bike cannot go.
From the word itself, hybrid bike is a mixed assembly of road bike and mountain bike. The tires used are road bike tires (700x25C or 23C), body geometry and handle bars are that of a mountain bike. Some hybrid bike used front suspension fork but if you want to gain speed you gotta lessen the weight of your bike so most hybrids have rigid forks.
When newbies ask about what brands to buy? My reply is ?õ????How much is your budget??õ???ù That narrows down the options because there are tons of good popular brands out there. And there are also good but not-so popular brand that can meet your specs.
Example of a hybrid bike.

Why are Turkish women so beautiful?	"When I first moved to Turkey I was blown away by how beautiful the women were.
I moved here with my two suitcases full of American clothes, and for the first month I looked so shabby compared to Turkish women because they are so well dressed.?ˇ Infact I learned a lot about fashion from women here.?ˇ In America I never cared overly about what I was planning to wear that day (college habits?õ????) but Turkey had actually taught me to be much more presentable everyday.

What is love?	"A lot of people were eager to point out that there are many types of love, and I think they?õ????re right. What I want to do here is take a second to talk about one specific type of love:
This is not an easy thing to explain, and you may want a quick bit of background before you read on. I wrote about why relationships fail in another answer here:
In that answer, I discussed the concept of resources/resiliency. If you don?õ????t want to read that, just know this:
Anyways, I concluded that unconditional love is not possible unless we rid ourselves of needs, which is only possible with essentially infinite internal resources. But this begs the question, if you don?õ????t have any needs, why bother being in a relationship at all? Wouldn?õ????t it be unsatisfying?
I had that same thought, and spent the rest of the weekend doing nothing but working through that idea. If you?õ????ve ever climbed a mountain, or even a big hill, and looked over the edge, you?õ????ll understand that an elevated perspective gives us the appropriate vantage point from which to see a more complete picture of the world.
Similarly, over the course of those few days, I eventually found myself in a place where I could see with great clarity, if only for a short time. Luckily, I wrote as I went. What follows is my progression through the idea of unconditional love. My intent with this writing is to present it in such a way that it allows you to take that journey with me and experience, if only for moment, what it might mean to love unconditionally.
With that, let?õ????s take a journey.
Our starting point is the following statement: complete independence is a prerequisite for unconditional love. We must have no needs.
The easiest way to make sense of this is to say that if we have needs, then we must have a set of conditions upon which a relationship rests, therefore ?õ????unconditional?õ???ù is categorically impossible when you have needs. Before you get angry, I promise I didn?õ????t write that long preface just to throw some semantic wordplay in your face. To fully understand the implications of this statement, we have to talk about needs for a second.
Needs are directly connected with resources, because we use resources to meet needs. These ?õ????resources?õ???ù might includes things like our time, energy, etc. Therefore, when we enter a relationship with needs, what we are actually doing is using the relationship as a resource, because the other person/the relationship as a whole is meeting our needs, which is what a resource is.
Now, we need resources to feel safer and more secure - they?õ????re essential to our resiliency. However, if our resources come form external sources, such as a relationship, rather than from within, our safety and security become dependent on something outside our control. If you lost these ?õ????external resources?õ???ù, you would be left unprotected. And this knowledge is not lost on you. Deep down, maybe even as deep as your subconscious, you know that losing these resources spells trouble, and so we fear losing them.
So, when you depend on an external resource, you must always fear its loss. Which means, while an external resource can technically increase your resiliency, it also brings with it implicit fear. Your resiliency becomes unstable; it becomes dependent; it becomes
?õ????So what? What?õ????s wrong with that??õ???ù I can feel that thought bubbling in your mind. I can feel the resistance, because I experienced the same resistance when I first came across this notion. The reason you likely feel this way is because for most of our lives, we?õ????ve come to understand love and relationships as some sort of agreement to trade complementary needs, and so imagining a different way of being is difficult, if not impossible. In order to fully understand the drawbacks of conditionality, we must first explore unconditionality. And for that, we must use our imaginations.
Imagine you have infinite resources. Your resiliency is through the roof. You?õ????re Superman. Now imagine those resources are actually internal resources. You have absolutely unshakable optimism, self-esteem, and energy. With infinite internal resources, there isn?õ????t a single problem you can encounter that can damage you.
However, unlike Superman, it?õ????s not because you are somehow stronger than the impending onslaught, but because ?õ????you?õ???ù is not a thing that can be damaged. You can ?õ????change?õ???ù, sure, but you can?õ????t become ?õ????worse?õ???ù. This is what self-esteem is. With ultimate self-esteem, you don?õ????t just believe, you
What a notion that is! Can you imagine feeling that way? No matter what happens in your life, what happens to you, what you lose, who leaves you or tries to put you down, that ?õ????you?õ???ù will always be intact, and that ?õ????you?õ???ù will still be whole. Talk about invincible! No need to worry about literally anything at all. Like an experienced practitioner of mindfulness, ?õ????problems?õ???ù become ?õ????things?õ???ù or ?õ????events?õ???ù because the implicit fear of harm is no longer there.
And the best part about living this way is that you can?õ????t lose internal resources the way you can lose external resources. You could wake up one day and your external resources may be gone - not the case with internal resources. When you feel this way, when you have infinite internal resources, your mindset becomes independent of the external environment, because there is no longer a link between your resiliency and the external environment.
Imagine that! No link between your circumstance and your mental state. You can withstand anything at all. Say goodbye to worry. Say goodbye to fear of loss. Not because you won?õ????t experience them, but because you?õ????ll brush them aside as unfounded because you?õ????ll remember that your internal environment greatly outweighs anything the external world can throw at you.
What we?õ????re imagining is a life of complete freedom. You are bound by nothing, because your resiliency is dependent on nothing except that which cannot be taken from you. Now, what I want you to do is take this notion and apply it to relationships.
I bet I almost lost you there. That last sentence might sound heartless to most of us at first, but it?õ????s actually quite the opposite. If we were to verbalize that gut impulse you just experienced, it could probably be posed as the following question: ?õ????If you don?õ????t care if the other person stays with you, why be in a relationship at all??õ???ù
This, dear readers, is unconditional love. Imagine you have zero needs, and you enter into a relationship. A hypothetical exchange with the other person may go something like this:
They have all their resources available to them, and you have not added any stressors, because you have no demands or conditions for them. This means they have more resiliency overall. You?õ????ve become a positive shift in their life.
Now imagine that they, too, have no needs. Here you are with all this time and energy to apply, and no constraints or requirements on how you spend it. The two of you become this unprecedented, unbound, unstoppable force of mutual growth, actualization, and love. Neither of you is there because you
Can you feel that? Are you beginning to understand what it might mean to love unconditionally?
I?õ????m going to finish with a metaphor that might help you build on that understanding, to feel what it might be like to come from a place of complete and total unconditionality.
Imagine you are a skilled painter (you might be one already). And imagine you meet someone who is also a skilled painter. Each of you is capable of creating a beautiful work of art on your own; you can paint beautifully in solitude. But the two of you decide to paint something together. Not with two separate brushes making two separate strokes at the same time; you decide to paint one painting with one brush, at the same time, with two artists.
You both put your hands on the brush. It becomes immediately apparent that you cannot actively pursue an image and make the other person understand; you cannot overpower them or impose your desires or expectations onto them. You cannot control the brush; you must surrender to the brush and let
Importantly, the other person has this same realization. Soon, neither of you is really guiding the brush. The art is not coming
At some point, you may both step back and look at what you?õ????ve created together. It?õ????s definitely not what you ?õ????intended?õ???ù, because you entered into it without expectation at all. Is it ?õ????good?õ???ù art? The question is irrelevant, because the work you have created cannot be compared to other paintings; it is a medium all its own. What matters is that together, you experienced this incredible state of being that exists somewhere between the two of you, tethered to each other by your grip, and yet unbound.
In reviewing your art, the two of you face a decision: Do you continue to paint together? Of course, you don?õ????t
Now, imagine you are a complete, whole person on your own, capable of happiness, fulfillment, and actualization. Imagine you meet another person capable of happiness, fulfillment, and actualization on
The point is, unconditional love is what happens when we are able to come from a place of complete independence; zero needs. From such a place, our motivation can be completely devoid of self-interest. It is no longer about any semblance of ego or acquisition; it is not a trading of needs. Instead, our motivational system shifts to one of
I hope that made some sense at all.
For the record, I did some searching, and I?õ????m not sure anyone?õ????s ever tried to paint with two artists using one brush at the same time. I think it?õ????d be a really cool new form of art, and I?õ????d love to see someone try it.

Agnosticism is a stage where one's not exactly sure but sort of is. It's like choosing 1/2 while options are 1 and 0.
They believe in
But I think, they're having first first stage first stage of first stage of it. They're maybe moving towards agnosticism, kind a lkle initial phase.
Being sceptical about God, purely is Atheism but since one are having that believing in religion it depends upon what are things that making them believe in religion? Is that unanswerable reasons? Mechanism of affairs? Just valid practices that make sense? Whatever it maybe, in In a way it's agnosticism yes, but in a way it not. Purely.
So I guess, it's better sticking what to be consider best and do a deliberate research on it.

How do I prevent my colleagues from putting me on a pedestal? Is there something that I'm doing wrong that I'm not aware of?	"As you?õ????ve discovered, some people just do tend to attract others in terms of being seen in a leadership role - and being put on a pedestal has its downsides. It?õ????s not that you?õ????re doing something wrong so much as you?õ????re doing too much right. Many people prefer to follow and as it?õ????s less responsibility and that means they can blame their leaders when something goes wrong - even if it?õ????s just the weather or the traffic. If you don?õ????t want to take on the negatives that go with being seen as a leader (especially when you may be getting few of the positives) then you have to make a point of sabotaging your own pedestal whenever you realise someone has placed you there. This may require being a little inefficient, more reticent at providing answers, stand out less from the crowd. But you?õ????ll have to ask yourself if it is worth it. It sounds like you have the potential to be quite successful in your career. And that will always result in people putting you on a pedestal whilst distancing themselves and blaming your attitude for their behaviour. if you want to succeed at your work then although you?õ????ll also need to cultivate good working relationships you?õ????ll need to accept that your colleagues are not your friends.

How can we find out what our life should be?	"A full understanding of the person you want to be, the things you want to see and accomplish, and the people you want to surround yourself with will not simply come to you in a cartoon-like lightbulb moment without experiencing the world around you. Try something new that involves meeting new people like ballroom dancing or a running club. Pick an instrument that looks interesting or fun to you and take the time to learn how to play it. Spend time with your friends and family - not just watching movies but going out and doing things: shopping, theme parks, the drive-in, camping, ski trips, road trips, etc. Work hard at whatever it is you?õ????re doing right now. If you have the economic means to do so, travel! See new places and experience new environments and cultures. Set aside your usual music playlist that you?õ????ve listened to a hundred times and try a new podcast. Spend time listening to people talk about what they do and the things they like and dislike about it. Read books. Search for new perspectives. If you find something interesting or that you develop a passion for, pursue it. Take a class, or look for opportunities wherever they may present themselves. Explore.
Do these things, and I assure you that you will start to build momentum and be able to better identify what you want your life to look like. I firmly believe that we define our own life?õ????s purpose, and it is up to you to figure out yours.

"My daughter's school (in Chile) just started to teach ""religion"" in first grade but it is only Roman Catholic belief. What should I do?"	"It's clear you are not on the U.S. because this practice is forbidden at public schools here. However, as a parent of a child in Catholic school I'll offer my perspective. We are (semi-practicing) Catholic but chose the school primarily due to the poor public school district we live in?õ????as do many other parents. There are kids of all faiths at his school.
The kids learn about aspects of Catholicism (simply Christianity really) but if they are not Catholic they will not take part in Sacraments. The reason they start ?õ????so young?õ???ù is that kids have First Communion in second grade so they are preparing those kids who are practicing Catholics for this sacred milestone. (This is the age in the U.S. at least; it may differ elsewhere but it will be elementary age.)
As at my son's school religion is only one facet of his day, and remember he's at a Catholic school not a public school with a religion class. For your daughter it will be one class not a total indoctrination. Teach her your beliefs at home while teaching her to respect the beliefs of others at school (and elsewhere.) Please be careful to refrain from maligning Catholicism and its beliefs. Kids that young are impressionable and easily pick up on cues from parents. It's not fair to other kids or teachers for her to blurt out ?õ????My mom says that's stupid?õ???ù in the middle of class.
By the way, there is nothing ?õ????scary?õ???ù about the Catholic faith. It's just a form of Christianity like Methodist or Presbyterian. If you are Jewish, Buddhist or atheist the belief system is obviously going to be different but the basic ?õ????love one another?õ???ù principle of being a good person is still sound.
Finally, take the time to ask questions to understand the curriculum of the class. Ask what a non-Catholic kid will get out of class and how her beliefs will be respected. She is certainly not the first they have encountered. Communication and dialogue go a long way to easing fears and promoting understanding.

Do zombies run out of energy?	"Well, I?õ????d say they do just like any biological organism.
But here?õ????s where we get into the difference between humans and zombies.
Humans when they get tired stop and rest, maybe eat and drink, and maybe sleep.
For humans, getting tired could lead to putting toxins in the body, lack of air, and even muscle liquedification if hot enough, such as from a full sprint.
This is what makes zombies seem energy-less. Their lack of survival mechanics make them appear full of energy all the time.
Ultimately this is another reason zombies are unrealistic, shows like the Walking Dead have zombies that last 10s of months. So not only are you putting aside the fact that they?õ????re decaying extremely slowly, you?õ????re also having to believe that they are able to survive longer than 3 days with all these energy drains they possess.

What would happen if everybody had a time machine?	"Oh crap.
That would be freaking awesome and terrifying
First off, yes!!!! I have my own time machine!!!
People would go back and change things immediately, for either personal gain or just for the fun of it. The world would become insanely messed up. The number of paradoxes that would ensue?õ????
Eventually, if they're still around, the police, fire fighters, ambulance, etc, would all make it their duty to fix the timeline. So they go back and forward in time, arresting people, stopping them from doing things, etc.
Slowly, our planet would become normal again.
Have you ever heard of the Flashpoint Paradox? It's a really screwed up version of the timeline the Flash created. Eventually, he fixed it, but when he came back, the world was?õ???? kinda different. It was small things, but things nonetheless.
That's what would happen to our world- small things would get disrupted. Perhaps one person has blonde hair instead of black. Maybe a dog is a cat instead. Maybe someone even switched genders.
The point is, everything would be different.

What is the most realistic military strategy video game on coordinating war effort?	"Normally, I?õ????d suggest the Total War games but you seem to be looking for something that?õ????s more large-scale than what the Total War games offer.
So thus, I will suggest Hearts of Iron IV.
I?õ????ve written about Hearts of Iron IV in the past, and it?õ????s one of my favorite games to play.
It is a game set between 1936 and 1948 and covers World War II. Many countries, from the Soviet Union and Italy to Brazil and Turkey are playable with their own starting stats, generals, etc.
The economy is somewhat-lacking (You trade in civilian factories rather than actual currency), and the AI can be a bit wonky (As with most strategy games), but otherwise it?õ????s a solid game.
You can control the Navy, Air Force, and Army, though the game?õ????s key focus is land combat. You have a control a nation through the years of the war, expanding your industrial capability, land troops, etc. while either fighting or avoiding the huge war. The first three years of the game are set on building up a wartime industry, training troops, and enacting policies (Better economy laws, changing ideologies, increasing conscription) until the war inevitably breaks out. You can play historically or ahistorically, depending on what you want.
The game has three factions, but through national focuses (Things you can research on your own that provide buffs to your country) others can be made. The three factions are the Axis (Led by Germany as you know), the Allies (Led by the U.K.), and the Comintern (Led by the Soviet Union, and has a few weakling Asian countries like Mongolia and Sinkiang that aren?õ????t a problem at all). You can choose to disband a faction as its leader or join a faction if you aren?õ????t.
Your units in the game (Called divisions) can be micromanaged by categorizing them into an Army of 24 (Sometimes more if you have very good generals) led by a general, which has a skill level (Which gives a combat boost) and often times a specific trait that can either be good for you or bad for you. For example, one of my best generals as Germany was very good at fighting on the offensive, but had a slower experience gain. When units are in an army, they can be assigned to a battleplan, which eventually gives a planning buff in combat.
Divisions are built up of companies, which vary widely and can be made stronger by research (For example, researching the Field Hospital reduces manpower loss in combat or the Logistics Company decreases supply use). Division design is crucial in this game. You can research three types of special units:
Paratroopers - Can be airdropped from transport planes. Very light, but can be airdropped. You cannot add any form of artillery to their division makeup or they will be unable to be para-dropped. Otherwise, they do not need a lot of supplies but won?õ????t be able to hold out in enemy territory due to the enemy?õ????s superior infantry units (Especially tanks).
Mountaineers - Mountain troops that take up more supplies to be trained but when crossing hills or mountains, which often grant a combat debuff, they are able to fight better against normal infantry in the aforementioned terrain. I like mountaineers for invading rocky areas like Iran, Turkey, Switzerland, etc. but otherwise do not train them in mass. I value mountain troops, and they are quite versatile. I often have a few trained just in case, and assign them alongside my normal infantry.
Marines - Marines, my favorite type of special troop due to their versatility, are land troops that have great logistical support and do not run out of supplies that fast. They also receive a combat buff when crossing rivers. They are best used for naval invasions, but if you spend enough effort improving their division design, they can be incorporated into large-scale attacks, much like Mountaineers. For example when invading the Soviet Union as Germany, I used Marines in my push to Stalingrad.
There are four ideologies: Fascist, Communist, Democratic, and Non-Aligned. Fascist and Communist countries can expand their conscription and economy laws at will, and can declare war whenever they please. When using the focus tree, Fascist nations get a major manpower boost. Communist focus trees gain political power and partisan suppression (Partisans are a problem in this game, especially in large countries like the United States or China). Democracies are very bad in this game, and while they get a construction boost (Or something of the sort), they are often fighting defensive wars. Non-Aligned is just for countries who don?õ????t want to get roped into a faction, and aren?õ????t that significant, they?õ????re just kinda-better democracies.
All nations have a focus tree. All members of the Allies (Including New Zealand, South Africa, India, etc.), Axis (Well, actually only the Reich, Italy, and Japan, not Hungary or Romania), and the Comintern (Only the Soviet Union, since the other nations were incredibly irrelevant during the war) have unique focus trees that allow for certain events to fire or for special buffs to occur. For example, you can go through with the Anschluss as Germany or purge your generals as the Soviet Union (Which in turn prevents a civil war). The unique focus trees do not actually have to follow through historically, and if you aren?õ????t playing historically, then you can also carve your own route.
Other than the aforementioned nations, all the other countries get a generic focus tree which is good but quite bland. Just like unique focus trees, you focus on the five core research points of the game: Politics, Industry, Army, Navy, and Aviation.
The game features a somewhat in-depth colonial and puppeting system, which may be helpful if you do not want to control land and have your puppets remain neutral during the war so your enemies can?õ????t invade them and gain their air bases, factories, etc.
As you can tell, the game is very in-depth, but once you get the hang of it, it?õ????s a blast. The developers are coming out with a new DLC soon that likely expands the roles of Spain, China, and a few other nations.
If you get bored of playing World War II, a very active modding community exists, with several overhauls such as Millennium Dawn (A modern-day mod), Kaiserreich (An alternate history mod where Germany won WW1), a World War 1 mod and even a Fallout mod in development.
I?õ????d suggest the game; It?õ????s got a great community and is a blast for trying out military strategy.

Why is Theresa May denying Scotland its right to a democratic vote about its future? The Scottish want to stay in the EU and want independence!	"It?õ????s probably best you don?õ????t get your history lessons from Mel Gibson films.
Braveheart?õ????s got nothing more than people?õ????s names in common with actual history.
You know what kingdoms did, especially Medieval kingdoms? They fought each other for supremacy. For example, after Bannockburn, Robert the Bruce sent his brother to invade Ireland, not just to expand the war against the English but his rivals, supporters of Balliol were there.
After the Treaty of Berwick, the Kingdom of Scotland?õ????s unchallenged independence lasted until the political union in 1707. 350 years. Not of peace, of course. There were still battles over the border. They were medieval kingdoms after all. This includes Flodden, fought in Northumbria. Why there? James IV, King of Scots, invaded England to support the Auld Alliance between Scotland and France. There were also civil wars within Scotland, and England would help one side. That happens too. There were religious wars, like when James V wouldn?õ????t break with the Catholic Church. That happened too.
But guess what? The Queen of England, Elizabeth I, died without issue and the King of Scots inherited the English throne. Let me repeat that, the King of Scots inherited the English throne. One more time, phrased slightly differently, the SCOTTISH king became the English king, not the other way round.
Now, for the next hundred years, there were two kingdoms with one king. There was no fighting. After Scotland went bankrupt, they joined into one kingdom. And Culloden? That wasn?õ????t England v Scotland. That was some Scots who supported the Jacobite claim versus other Scots who didn?õ????t, and the English fought with the latter, because that was a civil war, not between the Scots and the English, but between mostly Highland Scots and Lowland Scots/English.
Scotland had a failed attempt at empire. England was more successful. But do you know when it really took off? When BRITAIN forged an empire. AND the industrial revolution, and science, and arts, and all the other British contributions.
Your question reminds me of during the independence debate and a woman on the street in an interview said, ?õ????They treat us like dogs!?õ???ù Pardon me? More money is spent per head in Scotland than the rest of the UK. After years of hiding it, it finally comes out that, yes, Scotland spends more than it contributes to the treasury; England funds that extra spending. So, she was right, except, you?õ????ll notice dogs are treated quite nicely with the provided food and a warm bed.
I?õ????ll preface this by saying I voted Remain, but no, the EU is not the greatest union. The past 300 years show the British union to be the most successful union in history.

You may notice the hot plasma on the skin of your space suit. But you will be too busy to take in the incredible scenario in front of you. As you probably reach 15,000 feet, you will experience a sharp tug or jolt on your free falling body as your secondary (

Why do people use acrylic paint when repainting shoes?	"Combination of durability, weather + sun resistance, flexibility, and adherance to tanned leather + common finishes.

Now imagine if vaccines of smallpox were never made, hundreds of millions even billions of people will die waiting for some random genetic mutation that will make humans imune to it.
So why we do we really need vaccination?
To prevent human generation from being fucked up by diseases like smallpox.

In 2017, it is decreased more.
It was conducted to remove terrorists from Karachi.
I hope you will get your answer if you open the links.
Pakistan is sincere in eradicating terrorism that's why it is taking these measures. These operations are still going on and terrorists have lost their strength.
Now you will ask about some terrorists attacks which occurred in Pakistan.
For this I will counter question to you
No one.
Even developed countries like France face terrorist attacks.
I am eyewitness of two such cases and I have heard about many. Bad news get more ratings , that's why you only heard about terrorist attacks, never about failed terrorist attacks.

What makes a sound annoying?	"Here?õ????s an article on a study of annoying sounds:
According to the article, when people listen to an annoying sound, it triggers a response in the brain. The amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotions, tends to take over whenever one hears an annoying sound.
Researcher Sukhbinder Kumar of the Institute of Neuroscience at Newcastle University in Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K believes that it may be a distress signal that makes the amygdala act in such a way. Perhaps there were primitive links to these sounds.
Studies show that activity in the amygdala and the auditory complex varies between the annoying sounds and the not so annoying sounds. The spike in emotional activity caused people to perceive the sounds differently from something calmer, like water bubbling or a baby laughing.
Frequency ranged from 2000 to 5000 Hz were rated most unpleasant.

Is throwing your racquet in anger after losing a tennis match a sign of bad sportsmanship?	"To me,it surely is a sign of bad sportsmanship. If I coach a player, I can tolerate him smashing rackets in a private room or any place where he is alone, but to do it on court,and that too in front of your opponent is simply horrible.
People win and lose matches,it?õ????s a fundamental rule of tennis,and you should embrace the losses,but at the same time learn from them.Smashing a racquet will behoove neither the player nor the racquet.People often forget that it was the same racquet that made them hit great serves,stunning passing shots,crisp volleys,and a lethal ceoss court winner.I have never seen players thanking their racquet for the victory,then why do you have to smash the racquet when you lose one.Whatever sport you play, it should be respected.And smashing a racquet does come in a serious contempt of the game.There are other ways to deal with frustrations,learn and get over them.

"As an Indian, what is the reason that you want to marry in your own caste?"	"This is not an A2A. I wanted to say my views about this topic - caste marriages and hence this.
Your cousins just talked you out of the topic. How does being compatible with your partner really relate to coming from the same caste? Can you please ask them to explain this? I am willing to learn from them with humility.
These guys/girls are the regular people in our society who succumb to societal pressure. Class superiority/inferiority. Blah bla bla, no big deal at all. Societal pressure, big deal!
Now coming to the real question. If you ask me about the reason, I don?õ????t have any reason to marry someone from the same caste. My parents have some reasons and my relatives got even more reasons. But I just don?õ????t have any reasons. I am not that guy who gives in to societal pressure but may be I would compromise because I don?õ????t want to hurt my parents. They?õ????re 50 years old already.

Why do people believe in God rather than science?	"It?õ????s unfortunate that the many answers provided are so ingenuously naive and supercilious. It?õ????s conceited and patronizing to provide an explanation which characterizes theists as intellectually immature children and nontheists as enlightened scientists. It?õ????s conceited because it?õ????s historically inaccurate. The majority of our modern scientific theories and methods were developed by Englightenment theists, including the big bang theory, for example. It?õ????s irrelevant that the majority of scientists today are nontheistic, if that is even true. Science and theology are distinct intellectual fields, so if a scientist were theistic today, we might never know because it is not appropriate to mix theories from those distinct domains. Where there is a dichotomy, the reason is methodological, not psychological.
It should be obvious that the stronger claim that all theists are nonscientific and all scientists are nontheistic is false. If that is the meaning of the OP?õ????s question, then it?õ????s clearly a false dilemma. One example is sufficient to counter the claim.
A weaker claim might be that theists tend to be nonscientific and scientists tend to be nontheistic. That would be difficult to establish or deny, but you might generalize from polls of subsets of both groups. If that were the case, it still doesn?õ????t explain why some theists are nonscientific and some scientists are nontheistic. It?õ????s really this weaker existential claim which one needs to address. And logically speaking, it?õ????s possible that each theists who is nonscientific and each scientist who is nontheistic is so for their own distinct reasons. Any generalization over those groups needs to explain why it?õ????s not an overgeneralization and therefore a false characterization.
What surprises me most, however, from the answers given thus far is that the preferred explanation tends to be psychological. I think this might be because the nontheists providing the answer believe that (a) there is a dichotomy and (b) theists who reject science are irrational. That sounds like a confirmation bias to me.
Let?õ????s consider how we approach the question another way. Suppose we wanted to explain the differences between Newtonian and Leibnizean physics. We wouldn?õ????t immediately start explaining the difference by dismissing the one view (historically, Leibniz?õ????) as naive and irrational, then proceed with a psychological assessment of potential reasons for his irrational naivety. Normally, what we would do is look at the theoretical foundations for their differences. They are both making inferences, and interpreting their experience, from foundational axioms. If we can clearly state those axioms, then we can analytically compare them to find out which might be contrary or even contradictory with each others?õ????. That?õ????s the rational analytic approach. And it should be no different if you find a case where a theist is nonscientific or a scientist is nontheistic. If there are some common shared foundational beliefs, then perhaps we can generalize over the groups. Psychological differences aren?õ????t helpful and tend to be projected from our own cognitive biases.
There was certainly a period during Christianity where faith and reason were considered to be opposed, especially regarding metaphysics, which took a priority over physics. But that was a thousand years ago during the first half of the middle ages. Part of the reason for that was the loss of the body of classical literature up to then, and improvements in education coincide with the recovery of that literature during the last few crusades. By the 14th century, there is no fundamental opposition anymore. Reason and faith are considered perfectly compatible. Enlightenment theologians and natural philosophers continued to develop the scientific methods we have today starting with Descartes.
The modern opposition of theology and science, where there is an opposition, is methodological. It?õ????s also a minority in Christianity. The Catholic Church today, for example, fully accepts the theory of evolution and the big bang. Those Christian sects who reject such well established theories in science are exclusively protestant denominations based on
If instead you reject the fundamental belief of the inerrancy of the Bible, and you reject the interpretive methodology of literalism, there is no reason left for the Christian to reject science on Biblical grounds or the scientist to reject Christianity on scientific grounds. This is a really important point because there is no scientific reason to accept Christian fundamentalism and every reason to reject it. Within the history of Christianity, I think it should be considered as extreme as the sort of Christianity in the middle ages which brought about the Inquisition. Arguing against a group or belief set from the extremists or extreme beliefs of that group or set is an

Should I ask my friend to hookup?	"Yes you shoud ask but approach the subject indirectly. Start by asking a general question about sex as if you are looking for good information since you are, I assume, inexperienced, If you're really good friends you might even ask if she has had sex yet. Ask anything to get the topic out on the table. At some point then you can spring the question. And by the way be prepared for her to ask why you're asking her and not someone else and have some answer ready. Say something complementary about how you feel about her and perhaps that with a friend the first time won't be so scary. Don't profess love (unless you really do) and avoid any statement that sounds like it's because she?õ????s convenient. She will want you to acknowledge her uniqueness and that she is special in some way to you. Be a gentleman, if she agrees, and treat her with respect and deference showing her how much it means to you that she's in on it. Be a gentleman, if she declines, drop the subject and do not bring it up ever again lest she feel you are pressuring her. That would be the kiss of death for the relationship. Try not to let the experience change how you act around her or treat her. Remember the song ?õ????Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow??õ???ù.

What is the ultimate paradox?		
What do you think Mike Pence's role is in the Trump administration?	"*Consider why H. Clinton chose Kaine as her running mate. Virginia electorate, Spanish speaking electorate?õ????
During the campaign, Pence?õ????s role was simply to be there and help Trump win. Now, Pence?õ????s role is to mediate between the Trump White House, the Mitch McConnell Senate, and the Paul Ryan H.O.R. Will explain below.
Trump=The Hammer
Pence=The Glue that tries to put all those pieces back together.
I believe Bannon, Priebus, and Pence are the most influential figures orbiting Trump but for different reasons
Bannon is a proponent of what is essentially political blitzkrieg: Hit them (congress) hard and fast with so much and some will get through (passed). How's that working out for you guys?
Priebus (Chief of Staff and former RNC Chairman) has ALL the connections that Trump does not have but needs nonetheless. Trump was a former supporter to and donor of Bill Clinton?õ????so let's just say he was somewhat new to the Republican game by 12?õ???˝,13?õ???˝,14?õ???˝ in some ways
Now to my main point as it pertains to your question. Pence is a stoic Conservative that enjoys the unwavering support of the deeply Christian rooted and consistently Republican leaning voters from states such as Indiana. Let's just say Ted Cruz and Mike Pence enjoy that same fundamental support base. It?õ????s not that Trump needs the electorate from Indiana specifically. Rather, combine those reliably conservative votes with those in every other state in the country and you have a decent voter base already. Trump wanted to paint his Republican brush as broadly as possible during the campaign. I do not believe he has any problem contrasting himself ideologically from that of his own Vice President because that has created more room for support. Trump can say outlandish things and appeal to those voters that Pence cannot. Adversely, Pence remains consistently ?õ????principled?õ???ù in his conservatism and that might appeal to those (both voters and Congressmen alike) looking for a more steady brand of leadership.

How do you know if you're depressed and what actually is depression?	"Hi, I had my first episode of depression when I was 16 as well, and from your description, it does sound as if you may be struggling with major depressive disorder. I?õ????m very sorry to hear this, but your mood can improve with the aid of medicine and psychotherapy. In general, you may be depressed if you experience some of the following for two consecutive weeks or more:
This is not a full list, but it does contain some of the most common effects of depression. First of all, you need to speak to your parents. I actually forced my parents to take me to a doctor because I felt so bad. Be frank and honest, and encourage them to read up on depression and educate themselves. Once you talk to them, you need to make an appointment with a doctor ASAP.
If you absolutely cannot talk to your parents, you may want to speak to a guidance counselor or teacher at your school. Counselors have experience in this area, and may be able to get you help. Whatever you decide, you need to talk to someone NOW! Start with your parents. If you don?õ????t act NOW, your depression could linger for years.
On a positive note, there are numerous medications available that can help you with your depression. Psychotherapy is also effective; there are some people who can heal from depression simply by talking about their emotions. For most depressed individuals, it will take a combination of both. Don?õ????t give up, you can get your old self back - but you have to tell someone you?õ????re in pain first! Good luck, I believe in you!

Why is it that most laws of physics are linear or quadratic?	"As James said, a lot of models in physics has their limited range of validity and usually the models are obtained by a number of measurements which are then fitted to an appropriate mathematical curve. If the acquired data don't statistically deviate too much from the curve, one may talk about a sort of correlation between some physical values
Here one may see measured data and a fitted curve by some criterion:
Typically, this kind of complex dependency is simplified and given in a constant, linear or quadratic form around an
Nevertheless, even when you deal with some ?õ????elementary?õ???ù stuff like linear spatial dimensions or apparently linear time, they are linear only in a limited range of non-relativistic physics ?õ???? as soon as you deal with relativistic velocities and/or very massive objects, these become pretty non-linear. Also, if these had a more complex, a higher-order dependencies, our universe won?õ????t be stable enough to sustain life as we know it.
But, your question is probably about ?õ????fundamental?õ???ù dimensions, amplitudes of physical fields and ?õ????quadratic?õ???ù energies which embed these simple levels of mathematical dependencies. First of all, linearity and linear addition usually mean that there is a common
And in my personal opinion, some ?õ????obviously?õ???ù linear physical values like time and spatial dimensions are just macroscopic linearization/interpolations among many discrete particles (events, whatever) ?õ???? these are very deeply embedded into our physical theories, usually hiding their real discrete nature from us. Anyhow, I hope that this answer might help you to conceive theories from a bit different perspective.

Does follower of Christ automatically mean Christian?	"Personally, I feel the answer is no.
Someone could follow the secular teachings of Christ - loving one?õ????s neighbour, and understanding that one?õ????s neighbour includes even one?õ????s enemies; refusing to meet violence with violence; caring for the refugees, the sick, the poor, the hungry - and not be a Christian.
To be a Christian one has to believe that Christ is the Son of God who became human and died to save us for our sins, and was resurrected to show us that death is not the end.
Simples.
HOWEVER - I believe that the hypothetical follower of Christ who is not a Christian above has a place in Heaven. And the Christian above does not - unless that Christian has also followed Christ as the above non-Christian did.

Can I join 10 days Vipassana course without any knowledge about meditation?	"Thanks for the question. It may depend on the teacher and their requirements.
It is important to consider that meditation practice must suit the needs of today and integrate easily into your daily routine. It is quite likely that what we used to call enlightenment is itself evolving. So the method to achieve that will also be one that is evolving.
My first Master, Babuji simplified these things. In a previous life he was Patanjali, often called the father of yoga. He could, at a glance take you through all the stages of the spiritual path. It was a great good fortune to be able to meet him and experience this for myself. His method was one of practical experience and not a ?õ????teaching?õ???ù per se.
The reason I am mentioning this is that, Babuji explained, that liberation or moksha, once considered the goal of meditation practice, is actually an early attainment on the path and there is far more to be achieved after the cycle of rebirth is broken. These were his own discoveries, as the ultimate scientist of yoga, which included many more points and chakras beyond what was known previously. In this life he streamlined all of this.
He brought to light a new method based on yogic transmission which makes it easy for the average person to attain the highest spiritual goal within a part of this lifetime.
For me, when I met him my journey went at light speed. Nothing wrong with old practices but things evolve: lasers are now used in surgery where before it was a scalpel. Mobile phones replaced rotary phones, jet aircraft replaced the bi-plane, on and on.
If you are interested in taking an express train, you can try:
Meet with a trainer and take the sittings with transmission and see for yourself. It is free. No knowledge of meditation is needed, nor will you be given a study course, just direct experience. Not trying to divert your interest but I have been doing this a very long time and I?õ????m glad to share my own experience with others to save them as much time as possible.

The smoking gun? Film of Aldrin planting a waving American flag on the moon, which critics say proves that he was not in space. The flag's movement, they say, clearly shows the presence of wind, which is impossible in a vacuum. NASA says Aldrin was twisting the flagpole to get the moon soil, which caused the flag to move. (And never mind that astronauts have brought back hundreds of independently verified moon rocks.) Theorists have even suggested that filmmaker Stanley Kubrick may have helped NASA fake the first lunar landing, given that his 1968 film

They sued him for everything he had, house, car(s), everything.

"Generally speaking in games, what is better, ranged or melee characters?"	"?õ????Ranged?õ???ù characters are more often than not made relatively weaker and harder to develop in comparison to ?õ????melee?õ???ù characters, and right from the beginning, because it is expected that the player would find intelligent ways of optimizing and upgrading their abilities through gaining experience, raising levels and using customizations from several different sources (e. g. not just shops - side quests, additional and sometimes hidden ?õ????grind?õ???ù sites, etc.) Some games make it a tad more difficult to proceed this way, but it depends on the gameplay. These games also allow for some level of amalgation in between these two classes (?õ????KOTOR?õ???ù comes to mind), but it is often easier to pick up the ?õ????melee?õ???ù character and just force your way through by continually upgrading your armor and weaponry (it works pretty well with ?õ????The Legend of Dragoon?õ???ù, ?õ????Parasite Eve?õ???ù, and not so well with games like FF8/10).

Is cheating on a spouse worth it?	"It depends on the kind of marriage a person has. Despite our romantic fantasies, many marriages exist for more pragmatic reasons. And many marriages, perhaps most, that start off as romantic liaisons lose that over time, for a variety of reasons.
For relationships that are not (or no longer) based in emotional intimacy, cheating often occurs. Many famous people have had spouses that were parenting partners, business partners, or societal partners (like arranged marriages, for instance) but also had partners who provided the emotional and sexual intimacy that, for whatever reason, the spouse could not provide.
For instance, Franklin Roosevelt had a wife, Eleanor, for whom he had great respect as a powerful person?õ????but the emotional and sexual connection was lost, or perhaps never existed. He had a mistress as well, with whom he could share emotionally and sexually. I could give hundreds of other examples of this as well.
However, many (most?) people these days
And there is also the risk of transmitting an STD to the spouse?õ????ethically, this is unconscionable, and while you can be ?õ????careful?õ???ù, there is no perfectly safe sex if intercourse is involved.
For myself, I would never cheat?õ????it would harm *me* as well as the intimacy between myself and my partner. However, I knew from an early age (preteen) that I had no interest in sexual or relationship exclusivity; I have never agreed to it, and never asked it of a partner. Responsible non-monogamous relationships (the most common form is polyamory:
George Bernard Shaw, over 100 years ago, said: ""Confusing
A society in which people are told that monogamy is the only acceptable choice puts many people in a painful bind: opt for emotional and sexual intimacy within the marriage, which may or may not be there, or opt for exploring sexual and emotional intimacy outside of the marriage as well, which damages the potential for emotional intimacy with the spouse.
There are large numbers of sexless marriages, and part of this is due to the structure of monogamy. No matter how tasty a particular food is, if you had to eat it every day, and only that, you would get sick of it pretty quickly. If you had a wonderful teacher in kindergarten, but then had no other teachers for the rest of your education, you would be pretty stunted. Human dynamics are the same in intimate relationships.
I know many people who are in polyamorous relationships, and most of them keep a rich and active sex life, and find that having other relationships helps create more emotional intimacy with their current partner(s). While there are a few people who are incapable of being trusted at any level, the frequency of cheating in polyamorous relationships is *much* lower than in monogamous ones.

"If everyone could live anywhere in the world, would some countries become overpopulated?"	"At first yes then after that not so much. Put it this way internally in a country there are nice places to live and not so nice places. I would then put that forward first.
Why do people live in these not so nice places? They could just move to the nicer ones right? I mean who would live here?:
When they could live here:
The reason is money. People simply can?õ????t afford to up sticks and move. That?õ????s not how it works. Now consider countries with truly deplorable slums. at that point they would want to move out right? Well often times in their own country there are other places they could go, if they can afford it that is.
Consider the European Union and the freedom of movement within the borders. People moved to the places with work not the places that looked prettiest. Often it was to places that looked the worst. But the demand hiked the prices. Consider Luton. Not the prettiest of places but fairly middle of the road in parts look at the prices for rent
There are many many factors that come into play here. The ability to just move isn?õ????t something that everyone has. I certainly don?õ????t have that option to a large extent.
What you would see is short term over burden on the market of some areas. These would include many places in the west that are already preferred destinations. As soon as the people got there and realised they couldn?õ????t afford to live there and that there were no jobs left they would move on.
You would likely see some sort of shift over the short term with large groups turning up in places that were touted as good. This is the contradiction that we have here in the UK. Many those on the right who are anti immigration spend their whole time putting it all over the internet that if you come here you can claim hundreds of thousands of pounds from the government, get a million pound house and never have to work and if you don?õ????t get it quick enough mention racism. The Irony is that these lies are being put out there by them and then believed by the people that they don?õ????t want turning up. This is a grass is always greener over there type of situation.
What stops people moving to other countries right now is money. One of the only qualifications you need to get into a country is money. The more you have the easier it is. Yes you need to learn the language to a certain extent but if you are rich enough and can prove you have a full time translator on staff then you would get around some of that. Not to mention that you could easily afford to take an intensive language course on the basics.
The notion that people aren?õ????t free to move around because some big bad is saying no is just not true. It is social, personal and financial factors that really come into play.
Something to also consider are asylum seekers. If the place they live in is particularly bad then lots of countries have asylum programs that people can apply for.
Would overpopulation occur? Not likely at the scale of countries. On the community scale then yes. With too much pressure on a community it will break down and will no longer be the desired place to go. meanwhile places that have reduced communities see a lack of demand in housing therefore prices drop. If there are companies there they will want employees making it a favourable market for the employee meaning cheaper living and better conditions. What next. Well everyone goes there then don?õ????t they?
That is the basis of migrant labour. If your skills are in that much of a demand across the globe and you have the money to fly around on a whim then really you can already live wherever you please.
In conclusion then the premise is in itself flawed as I have shown. What one person finds desirable about a place others may hate. Personally the only outcome I could see what be a bigger surge in nationalism and the removal of welfare and social programs from those countries that have them or at the very least incredibly tight restrictions.

What do we need to do to remove the Gandhi family from Indian politics and start a new INC?	"Like any Indian the Gandhi family too has right to be in politics and any well wishers of the nation would never wish that they leave the party - for what would a congress be without the Gandhis. Had Shri Rahulji not been at the helm of the congress - will people have voted for Namo. Actually life has contrast and importance of light can be known only in presence of darkness.Food becomes important and essential when one experiences hunger. Value of liquid/water is known only when Thirst exists. Opposites define the life and values . So pace of the development was 3?õ????4 % during times of earlier PM?õ????s from this dynasty - hence current dispensation got chance to project and do 7?õ????8 % growth. Had we become developed nation in last 60 years, then our set of problems would have been same as Europe and USA> So Gandhis need to be with congress to ensure that it is finished off . Then something can rise from the ashes. Congress if you see the history was created by Britishers as a safety valve. So someone else will create another congress. Personally i believe we are better of f without a rejuvenated congress. May God give them the courage to retain the Gandhis as leaders and appoint the next generation too .

When could money and peace be directly proportional?	"Thanks for A2A .
Well I will say money is something which have capabilities to tranform your status or level in society, but it may make you somewhat dishonest or disappointed in a long term.
I read it somewhere on quora only it is like fuel to your life car. You can walk to your goals but yeah if there is free car service available why won't anybody use it. It's fast, comfortable. Isn't it. Where is happiness ? It's there all you need to look for it. Journey !! Guys that's what make us happy, not the goal. So if you use that car service then you may miss a lot of point in your journey to the goals. But believe me always choose to walk on these paths and it will make you learn to be happy in every point of your life. One should enjoy every moment in his or her life.
Well there are some points when you will find yourself in situation like a river where you don't know how to swim or there are some alligators well there money can help you as a boat. But remember these moments are really?õ????very small. And nothing can be done in this type of situation. So I will say search for happiness in the journey not the goal.
And always enjoy the journey of life.

The important point is that reallocation and copying elements from old to new array is expensive. So you want to minimize it. At the expense of memory usage, you minimize this by allocating sufficient memory on each reallocation so as to (hopefully) reduce the potential need for next reallocation.

Then I would get on the phone and try to find out where all my family and loved ones are and how many of them are still alive. Then I would call my team of friends and see where they are at and where we can all meet up to move out of the city and to a safe location in the country. Once the whole group is together I would take a select few to go back into the city and load up on all the things we will need to survive.
We would hit weapon catches, markets and pharmacies to collect ammo, guns and gear as well as meds, food and water. I already have several locations market on my map where it would be the easiest to get all the things we need. When we have everything our last stop would be to gather gasoline and or to switch vehicles. gas can be gotten from other cars or at gas stations that have very little people going to them.
Once we are loaded I would go to my safe location out in the country where we would organize regroup and then I would send scouts to examine how bad things are. If things are really bad I would need to find a better more fortified location that would allow us to grow food and start rebuilding civilization.
Finally when we are settled in and everybody knows what their job is I would send out scouts to look for more survivors and to keep scavenging gear and supplies.

How do I get my mom to understand that I do actually have depression?	"I have a slightly different perspective on your situation and will offer two alternative approaches you might try depending on the situation. First, recognize you cannot change her mind. You can present evidence in articles from scholarly magazines, take her for a chat with your psychologist and/or psychiatrist and talk to her till you are blue in the face, but if she chooses to discount all of that then she will.
That said, you must decide how much it takes out of you to present the evidence and potentially have her ignore it. Based on your question, I would likely have to set a boundary around this issue and simply not discuss it with her anymore. If she brings it up in your presence, you simply say, ?õ???? I am not willing to discuss that area of my health with you.?õ???ù Then you calmly change the subject. Repeat as often as necessary until she moves to another topic. I had to do this with my father when it came to discussions about my needing to lose weight. I'll spare you the details, however, when I got my depression under control, I was able to take off more than 200 pounds. And more importantly keep them off for 10 years and counting.
Alternatively, assuming she is less hostile about the issue than your question makes it sound or you can handle her negative comments on a more limited basis, you could take an approach similar to what I did with my father regarding my depression. I would share things like how the medications we were trying operated in the brain to improve mood as I understood it, discussions I had had with my psychologist and snippets about research I had read or heard about. It was always in the natural course of conversation and not something I focused on. He never said to much about the what I was saying and the conversation would naturally drift on to other things. However, the years of discussions evidently added up.
He was a few years past eighty and I made a comment similar to many I had made over the years since my first psychiatric hospitalization concerning my treatment or some such. I was floored when, for the first time, my father acknowledged the likely genetic link in my problems depression. ?õ????""I knew your mother?õ????s father had killed himself before we ever got married. I just never thought about what it might mean.?õ???ù
So, ten plus years of just casually addressing it and he finally accepted the reality of what I have been dealing with since I was 14 years old.
I hope this answer proves useful to you.

The degree taught me how to understand and analyze the world. It wasn?õ????t a stepping stone to a specific profession, nor did I expect it to be.
I found it easy to go from that MA program to freelance writing ?õ???? pretty much everything I wrote sold quickly to major publishers. But that didn?õ????t pay very well, so I hopped to the other side of the desk and trained to be a freelance editor.
I guess I get bored easily. I currently give workshops, edit, own a publishing company and a crowdfunding company, and am helping develop a couple of software platforms. I?õ????ll probably be doing something different in a year or two.
I?õ????ve never had a real job, or seriously wanted one. Doing what I feel like doing is a lot more fun and usually pays better.

How do you feel about today's American dream?	"Adapting to the ""New Normal"" has substantially redefined the American Dream.
When the US ceased being an industrial giant it switched to consumerism and high technology to replace the missing base.
The challenge resulting from that transition has been in leaving the American worker behind and with corporations that are operating globally on a supply and demand basis responding to shifts in demographics, economics and the resulting markets.
I find the Time Magazine article by Fareed Zakaria, ""How to Restore the American Dream"" an interesting analysis and positive future forecast. The link to the article is below.
In essence we must climb on the World Economic Train as individuals, businesses and as a government or be left behind by those who are on board and leaving the station.
It will require a shift in thinking, an emphasis on education, diversity enhancement and strong doses of American ingenuity and hard work.
When we have adjusted, unemployment will improve and not before.

"Since, according to reports, massive civilian deaths are being caused by US-led airstrikes, should this strategy be discontinued? Why or why not?"	"YES!
As I say
?õ????For each terrorist killed by a drone strike, ten new are born?õ???ù
First of all, drones do not kill terrorists. Drones produce terrorists. Most victims of drones are innocents. When they are killed, hate grows against the USA. And then the relatives of these victims use violent ways against USA and other governments who ally with it against terrorism.

Why aren't pykrete aircraft carriers used today?	"The main problem found in WW2 was that pykrete needed steel reinforcement in order to work reasonable well as a ship. That destroys much of its utility. Regardless of what people claim, it was not a particularly bad idea. It was simply not needed.
However, I would think that it could be an attractive building material for such things as temporary airfields, bridges and other structures in the Arctic. Possibly with liquid nitrogen as cooling. But it would require some testing first and possibly prefabrication of reinforcements. It may also be that the mix would have to be changed. e.g. including sand or earth in the mix.
It would be interesting to see if such thing is feasible.

"Where can I get donated, freshwater, pet fishes, and can I get these fish for free?"	"Many aquarium shops have fish that have outgrown their original owners?õ???? tanks and were given back to the shop, and there are occasionally people who run rescues for fish that have been given up by their owners. Stores will generally not give you the fish for free, and I am not sure about rescues.
However, and this is key, you will generally not find fish suitable for a ?õ????medium sized?õ???ù tank (I?õ????m assuming this is something like 55 gallons. <20 gallons is generally considered small, >100 gallons is large, and 200?õ????225 gallons is about the maximum I?õ????ve seen for an ordinary stand alone aquarium. Above that you pretty much have to take out a whole wall. Water gets heavy very quickly!)
The fish that get given up by their owners are almost always large fish that people bought when they were little babies without bothering to research their adult size. These are fish that can grow to a foot long or more?õ????I?õ????m talking about pacu, red tailed catfish, clown loaches, arowana, gars. You generally won?õ????t find gouramis or African cichlids here.
I myself have clown loaches that were given up by their original owners. But I have a large tank, not a medium-sized one.

My son is 13 year old. He has female type breast. What should I do?	"If you set aside the circumstances, these appear to be lovely developing young female breasts, probably already close to or a full B cup, well on their way to a full-busted C or D cup or even more, and with puffy, expanding feminine nipples, showing tendencies to become that wonderful elongated type later on. I mean at 13, there is a lot more development still to come. With the growth that should occur over the next several teen years, the current somewhat conical shape should be expected to round out and become full and heavy.
Because your son is fortunate enough to have breasts that are, at a minimum, semi-self-supporting, there probably is not much bounce going on, but I would bet a lot of cute jiggling. Also, most likely a lot of high beaming, with nipples tenting out and, especially in the cooler weather, poking through tops. They and not wide-set, as you typically see on males. In short, these are breasts most every 13-year-old girl would love to have.
I think your son needs to start wearing a bra. A cami with a shelf might be a good alternative for around the house. Setting aside gender, any person developing such full, feminine breasts would have already been wearing a bra for some time, both for comfort and appearance. I am sure his growing nipples and breast tissue are sensitive, and a soft supportive bra should make him much more comfortable.
Also, I am sure the movement on his chest and the pointy, tenting of his tops draws attention and makes him self-conscious. A bra would hold everything in place and give a nice attractive rounded look to his chest. Because he is lucky enough to have firm self-supporting breasts, lift is not an issue, but wearing a bra should help with the sagging we all face as we age.
I predict that once he starts wearing a bra he will feel way more comfortable and confident and far less shy.

What advice would you give a 15-year-old for joining the Army?	"Graduate high school. Read military History. David Grossman, Anton Myer. Join the cross country team, especially if you suck at running.

Make your bed.
Learn how to shoot a 22. Go camping, climbing all that boy scout stuff.
Whatever you really suck at, work at that. Hang out with champions, guys who are trying to get good at stuff, whether it be running, football or chess. Video games will not help. Running in the rain will. People will make fun of you because you suck at running, wear funny clothes or challenge you with ?õ????ok then judo me.?õ???? Walk away from idiots.

What is catabolism in biology?	"As a short answer (and within a little bit of context):
Metabolism is the equilibrium of all biochemical reactions in a living organism. Metabolism is regulated in all the chemicals reactions so that the organisme remains alive.
The metabolic reaction are classified in two category: the reactions of construction (anabolism) and the reactions of degradation (catabolism).
The anabolism is when you put building blocks together to build bigger molecules. For example you create a muscular tissue or you store energy as fat. Those are the product of anabolism.
Catabolism is quite the reverse. You take big molecule and cut it in building block or you consume the building block into very simples molecules (CO2 for example). A living organism like our body do so for some purposes:
When you have the autumn leaves that fall on the soil and get decomposed by microorganism - it is catabolism.
In short, catabolism is deconstruction of something in the basic units. Those units can be: amino-acid, sugar hexes (sort of carbon molecular ring) or fatty acid parts.
Catabolism also refer to the consommation of the smaller unit for its energy content, for example the Citric Acid Cycle (also called Cycle de Krebs) who consume the sugar derivative in order to get energy. It is in nature a catabolic reaction.

Is it right that Child Protection Services can take your child?	"What!!!. You think your child is ?õ????yours?õ???ù, as in to you own them? You can?õ????t abuse animals even if they are ?õ????yours?õ???ù. You can?õ????t own human beings even if you give birth to them. I think you are not thinking this through. By all legal and moral norms you do NOT ?õ????get to do what you want?õ???ù with your child or any other human. They have all inalienable rights that you do. We don?õ????t think you can buy and sell and borrow against or mortgage or loan or gift human beings either. Before the end of the Civil War some people in the US still thought that was okay. But they were wrong, and even at the time much of the world thought they were wrong. We no longer think children (or wives) are chattel. You can not sell your child. You can not have sex with them. You can not beat them and many, many other rules. Legal guardianship is not same as owning. It has responsibilities and limits. The law that a wife was the property of her husband, had been abolished in England in 1857.
In 1874, a badly beaten girl known only as Mary Ellen Wilson became the first legally recognized victim of Child Abuse in the United States. Before 1874, society offered little protection for minors. Children were considered the property of their parents, and neither the government nor private individuals intervened when they were injured, overworked, or neglected. Mary Ellen was rescued from unfit parents only after the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) stepped in on her behalf. ASPCA advocates pointed out that if Mary Ellen were a horse or a dog, her mistreatment would be prohibited by statute. A judge agreed that the young girl deserved at least the same protection as an animal. At the time of the trial Mary Ellen was 10 years of age, the deliberate cruelties and deprivations inflicted on Mary Ellen Wilson by her adopted parents included the following:
That was a long time ago.
The New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and several Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals across the U.S. joined together to form the American Humane Association in 1877.

I moved from the west to the east coast to be with my new spouse and feel that I compromised more than I should have. What is the best way to cope?	"The question is not to cope but to embrace the decision you made. You did not compromise more than you should have. Stop questioning yourself.
You made a decision for a reason. Own it and remember those reasons. It?õ????s natural to start second guessing decisions, but the way to stop that is to embrace the life you moved toward. Look for what you are enjoying. Look for what is new not what you lost. Also think about other areas in your life where you focus on what you lost instead of what you gained. You probably do it in other areas as well and it?õ????s going to make you miserable.

What are the benefits of Brexit?	"I just returned from a business trip back to UK. I get the strong feeling that ultimately Brexit is about immigration. There's a lot of people who are worried that Britain's infrastructure simply can't cope any more. There's some who feel that the character of its towns and cities is changing too much, and are unhappy to hear all these strange languages being spoken.
The real ""benefit"" of a Brexit is that UK
There's a willingness to lose out economically if it means less immigration. It's perfectly clear that Brexit will mean a recession - the only question is how deep.
This logic is unfortunately misguided as Brexit does not necessarily mean that EU citizens cannot come freely to Britain any more to work. Of course, the UK will not be part of any EU initiative to take in refugees - but it already has its opt-outs.

What is one ridiculous reason for which you got kicked out of class?	"I used to live in Colorado. About 2 hours south of Denver is a lovely city called Pueblo.

What is the difference between black magic and white magic?		
Why do people with borderline personality disorder lie so much?	"Picture:
Not all those with BPD are pathological liars and for an update on why some of those with BPD do lie we go to BPD Central for expert answers on this question. The following is informative:
?õ????Some statements may start out as deliberate lies; over time, they become real (the old saying, ""Tell a lie often enough and it becomes the truth""). Some statements may be exaggerations, such as a woman accusing her husband of ""strangling her"" when he touched her neck. People with BPD--especially the conventional type--may judge themselves harshly and expect others to do the same. Lying serves to deflect shame when something might make them look bad, thereby maintaining whatever self-esteem they have on a temporary basis.
This backfires on those people with BPD who then feel worse for having lied (or at least being found out).We all have things about ourselves we would prefer others not know. But we see the good and the bad and hope others do, too. With their black and white world and rejection sensitivity, people with BPD believe that anything ""bad"" would make others reject them.
Lies may create drama and gain attention. One woman lied that she had been raped to get her boyfriend's attention when he had not been paying enough attention to her. Lies may mask real feelings and put up an impressive fa?ü??ade; this is especially common with invisible BPs. Lies may help make sense of why things happen to them in their mixed-up identity.?õ???ù

One of the things people don't realize about plagiarism is that it isn't always intentional. Some kids just don't get it. Turnitin is a great tool for showing students what's going on. When I tell a student that he got a 30% similarity count, that's a great time to point out that it means that nearly every third word (on average) was written by someone else. That's a bit more shocking to them and brings it all into focus. Then we can compare it to a lower paper and see what that student (appropriately) to get a better grade.

A rematch of the 2015 final where Barca triumphed over Juventus by 3?õ????1 . But 2 years have passed. Juventus are looking stronger. Although they have lost Pogba and Tevez , they have bought quality reinforcements such as Dybala , Pjanic , Higuain . As for Barca they completed a sensational comeback against the Parisians. Their forward line is perhaps the best in the world right now. But Juve are no pushover. They are into the finals of the Copa Italia and looks set to win the league as well.

Perhaps the most exciting encounter of the tournament . Both attack minded teams. It is Carlo vs Zidane. Carlo landed LaDecima with Real 3 seasons back and is on course to win the league. Zidane is 3 points ahead with a game in hand to win LaLiga for Real for the first time in over 5 years. They have won the CL 2 times in last 3 years. But Real look shaky in defence . Both Varane and Pepe are out. Bayern on the other hand look menacing. But If Real can withstand the Bayern pressure they can qualify to the next round with some famous names in their midfield and attack. Modric and Kroos will be key to this tie along with Thiago , X.alonso and Vidal. But never rule of Sergio Ramos and CR7 . Lewandowski could decide the tie on his own as well with his goals. But Real looks really good when it comes to Champions league .
I'll pick Real in this one
4. Atletico vs Leicester City
What a fairytale run it has been for Leicester . They surprised everyone last year and are surprising everyone in the CL as well. Atletico needs no introduction. The Diego Simeone led side have reached the finals on two occasions in the last 3 years but lost in both the occasions. This season they are looking good with Gameiro , Greizmann and Carassco racking up some good goals. Leicester on the other hand have sacked their manager and lost Kante in the summer. They have regained their form of late with 5 wins in the last 6 games. But Atletico are set to overpower them with their experience and flair upfront. But Leicester could surprise them.
My pick will be Atletico in this one.
So semi finals
Borussia Dortmund
Real Madrid
Barcelona
Atletico Madrid

Should the government be able to censor the internet?	"Thank you, Devin Mckinley, for the A2A.
I?õ????m 63 and have spent my adult life (and a good portion of my pre-adult life) being concerned with the concept of government limitations on individual expression.
Should the government be able to censor the Internet?
That depends entirely on to whom you talk. The Chinese and North Korean governments have no problem censoring what gets into their countries. There was a time ?õ???? nominally 30 years ago, of course ?õ???? when the US government had the ability to shut it down completely and have it revert to its original intent: research and military logistics (?õ????The Lord giveth?õ?????õ???ù).

Have there been any professional tennis players involved with illicit drugs?	"Yes, of course. Andre Agassi wrote about a period of meth use in his book. Speed played a major role in his falling off the edge of the earth in terms of his ranking. Jennifer Capriati was dogged by drug rumors and issues and is still struggling, allegedly, to this day. Torbin Ulrich (Lars Ulrich of Metallica?õ????s father) was a known marijuana and LSD user. He wasn't a particularly famous player, but a tennis professional nonetheless. Macenroe was into drugs around the Tatum O'Neal period, and she wrote about it in her book (she alleges cocaine and marijuana). More recently, performance enhancing drugs have been en vogue, and it is highly probable that Nadal and Djokovic were both drugs cheats.
In fact, there was a book written about recreational drug use in tennis; I can't remember the authors name off the top of my head, but I think he played basketball for Duke (when they sucked). He does a sports radio show that is on (or at least was on) in the Bay Area.

Why does Superman seem relatively weak in Man of Steel (2013)?	"Check out the angle he?õ????s pushing from to protect that helicopter. If Superman?õ????s strength is a straightforward upscale of human strength, the girder he is pushing on wouldn?õ????t have done squat to protect that helicopter. It would have sheered just above his head and he?õ????d be standing in a hole surrounded by the collapsed structure.
So, let?õ????s assume that Supes?õ???? strength doesn?õ????t work that way, that the pressure from his hand (and head from the picture) is somehow spread more evenly across the structure. If there?õ????s still a leverage component, well, his fingers would be the fulcrum and the torque of his grip would still be the force shifting the whole thing.
But, yeah. Superman is almost always rendered inconsistently throughout any story, even in the comics.

How is Tetris related to math?	"There is a well-known math problem that is related to Tetris:
Given a 10x10 grid (half the one they use in Tetris), can you fill it out using only the T-piece?
I?õ????ll let you think about it a little bit ?õ????
The answer is
Notice that the number of black grids equal the number of white grids.
If we consider a T-piece, it comes in two flavors:
Notice that there is a discrepancy between the number of black and whites for each t-piece (two more of one color than the other). So, in order for the grid to be filled out perfectly there must be an equal number of both types of pieces.
However, the number of t-pieces that will fit into the grid is
The t-piece is the only piece in Tetris that exhibits an uneven parity among all the pieces. All the others have an equal number of black and white squares. Therefore,
Although this is nice in theory, how does it play out into practice? In order to have nice and neat stacking, we want to have the difference between black and white squares covered by pieces to be as close to zero as possible. The placement of your t-pieces then becomes critical. Doing something like this is dangerous:
The number of white pieces on the board is now 6, compared to 2 blacks, leading to a difference of 4. Having a high difference is one of the main causes for hard situations like these:
This unevenness will persist throughout your field until you fix it with another T-piece. But until then, you?õ????ll have to fight through the unevenness.
Parity is one of the few mathematical concepts that make a big difference while actually playing. One of the easiest ways to maintain parity is to keep your t pieces attached together as follows:

How can I be a good fighter?	"Becoming a good fighter will depend on your training, your ability and you instructor (coach).
Practice will be a major part of your training. Most important is that you have many different opponents. Sparring with the same partner will not give you the variations of fighting style and body type. Of course, fighting regularly in tournaments will give you variety and experience. Over time your ability will improve.
One thing you can do is to video your matches. This will help you evaluate your technique. If you identify your strengths and weaknesses, you can correct you weaknesses and reinforce your strengths. You instructor can go over these with you and offer suggestions.

What is the difference between startup incubators and accelerators?	"The words incubator and accelerator are commonly used interchangeably and that is why the difference between the two can be confusing. However, I believe there are characteristic that differentiate between the two. I will go over each individually to make it easier for you to understand the difference.
An incubator can be thought of as a beginning place for startups. Incubators usually take on teams that have just began to turn their idea into an actual company. Incubators usually give early stage startups the right tools to boost their company forward such as co-working space and mentors. One of the main purposes of an incubator is to push startups to test their products as much as they can and develop a scaleable business model. Many incubators are specialised into sectors, such as FinTech, MedTech and etc. If your team has an MVP or the business is pre-revenue, then an incubator could be the perfect opportunity for your team! Think of them as primary school, where startups learn the basics.
Accelerators on the other hand, are for more developed startups. Accelerators usually look for startups that have had initial traction, built a team that is confident in executing their idea and have at least a prototype of their product released. Accelerators are usually very intensive, making startups achieve growth that would usually take years. Once a startup is in an accelerator, the accelerator offers a huge network of mentors, investors and professionals, investment (sometimes in return for some equity) and usually some work space for the startups. One of the most major functions of an accelerator is to get a startup ready for investment. This means utilising the initial traction to catapult the startup to a revenue generating company. If incubators are middle school, then accelerators are college for startups.
I recently took part in a panel discussion on accelerators, which you can check out
I hope this helps understand the difference between accelerators and incubators. If you are uncertain whether or not a accelerator is an accelerator (or an incubator), check what they offer. If it seems more basic, then it is likely to be an incubator. If your business ever needs any legal help, feel free to

How do I remove the remnants of a virus?	"If you have ?õ????got a virus?õ???ù in the sense that an antivirus product has found one in an unread email attachment, then the antivirus will remove the entire thing, but it wasn?õ????t a problem in the first place because you never opened the attachment.
If your computer has actually been infected - the virus has been executed - it?õ????s not so simple. Antivirus mostly works by identifying patterns in files; it will detect the original attachment, but not changes made to the operating system. Your best bet may be to identify the virus with an antivirus product - upload the file to virustotal if you can find it - then google for ?õ????how to remove xxx virus?õ???ù on a tech page that appears to have been written by someone competent.
I am more familiar with removing malware from Linux. In that case, I backtrack to find when the malware first appeared then look for any files that changed at that time, check what they are and whether they should be there. System files for instance all date to when the machine was installed, with regular patterns of updates since then. A system file that just happened to change yesterday around the time you got a virus is highly suspicious. In RedHat Linux I can identify system files that changed unexpectedly by checking against the package database with ?õ????rpm?õ???ù. I don?õ????t know how to do that in Windows, but I had some hopes that
Some remnants of a virus will be harmless - data files for instance, like a list of IP addresses to contact. Some changes you would have to remove manually - changes to your browser home page or search engine for instance. Other malware downloaded by the virus you would hope would also be identified by antivirus/anti-malware products. Some changes will be effectively harmless - a registry change to run a program at boot, but antivirus removed the program.
I don?õ????t know enough about Windows to advise on reset or reinstall procedures. On Linux I prefer to take a couple of hours to trace the malware than a few weeks to re-install and reconfigure an entire operating system that represents years of accumulated user changes. If you never tuned things much, never installed a lot of third-party software, and have your personal data safely backed up, it may be quicker to do a complete re-install or reset. You should scan the backups to make sure you install a clean set saved prior to the infection.

Do Republicans oppose the welfare state out of Racism?	"This obsession with accusing every Republican policy as racist is getting a little old. No Republican?õ????s don?õ????t oppose welfare out of racist views.
The following excerpt is from the 1884 biography by Edward Sylvester Ellis,
?õ????The power of collecting and disbursing money at pleasure is the most dangerous power that can be entrusted to man, particularly under our system of collecting revenue by a tariff, which reaches every man in the country, no matter how poor he may be, and the poorer he is the more he pays in proportion to his means. What is worse, it presses upon him without his knowledge where the weight centers, for there is not a man in the United States who can ever guess how much he pays to the government. So you see, that while you are contributing to relieve one, you are drawing it from thousands who are even worse off than he. If you had the right to give anything, the amount was simply a matter of discretion with you, and you had as much right to give $20,000,000 as $20,000. If you have the right to give to one, you have the right to give to all; and, as the Constitution neither defines charity nor stipulates the amount, you are at liberty to give to any and everything which you may believe, or profess to believe, is a charity, and to any amount you may think proper. You will very easily perceive what a wide door this would open for fraud and corruption and favoritism, on the one hand, and for robbing the people on the other. No, Colonel, Congress has no right to give charity. Individual members may give as much of their own money as they please, but they have no right to touch a dollar of the public money for that purpose. If twice as many houses had been burned in this county as in Georgetown, neither you nor any other member of Congress would have thought of appropriating a dollar for our relief. There are about two hundred and forty members of Congress. If they had shown their sympathy for the sufferers by contributing each one week's pay, it would have made over $13,000. There are plenty of wealthy men in and around Washington who could have given $20,000 without depriving themselves of even a luxury of life. The congressmen chose to keep their own money, which, if reports be true, some of them spend not very creditably; and the people about Washington, no doubt, applauded you for relieving them from the necessity of giving by giving what was not yours to give. The people have delegated to Congress, by the Constitution, the power to do certain things. To do these, it is authorized to collect and pay moneys, and for nothing else. Everything beyond this is usurpation, and a violation of the Constitution.'""

What do you think of the future of Taiwan?	"Taiwan?õ????s future, as far as cross-straits relations are concerned, should be examined in the context of two key points:
Taken together, this means the most likely outcome is an enduring status quo. If we?õ????re lucky, a mutual cultural affinity and economic self-interests will draw the two governments closer over time. Best case scenario, the China/Taiwan relationship will become like the USA/Canada relationship.
Outside of cross-straits relations, I think Taiwan will be alright. With an educated, skilled workforce, strong infrastructure, geographical proximity to major consumer markets, etc, there is strong potential for future growth, and any demographic challenges can be off-set by increasing the use of automation/robotics.
Setting aside the narrow lens of our present day perspective, there are many reasons to be bullish on Taiwan?õ????s future.

"When you compress a gas, does it get cooler or warmer?"	"Thanks for the A2A.
The above equation depicts the combined gas equation. where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the initial and the final stages of the gas
This can be done through an isobaric process ie, the pressure doesn?õ????t change. In this case, the equation indicates that the final temperature will be less than the initial temperature.
This can also be done through a isothermal process ie, the temperature remains a constant and the final pressure is greater that the initial pressure as the equation above indicates.
It can also be done through an adiabatic process ie, a process with no heat transfer between the system and the surroundings. In this case, P*V^gamma is a constant. So, substituting this in the combined gas equation, we get that the final temperature of the gas is greater than the initial temperature of the gas.
So, the temperature change depends upon the process chosen.

Can I use a British Law degree in America or I still have to sit the Bar?	"Yes, the UK is a common law system, but you would not have studied US case law, civil or criminal law or procedures or demonstrated in any manner competence to practice law in the US. If you know which of our 50 states you are considering, please check their individual state bar website for the requirements to be admitted to practice there. We must apply and gain admission to practice in each state separately.
In the US, we must have a juris doctorate in all but one or possibly two states in addition to meeting other requirements to sit for the bar exam. California still allows a person to study under a licensed attorney individually and sit for their bar exam, although as a practical matter I cannot recall hearing of anyone in recent decades passing the bar exam in that state without having a law degree. Off the top of my head, I don't know of any other state that still allows ?õ????reading the law?õ???ù in lieu of a JD.
I know that many foreign law graduates who want to practice in the US will complete the LLM degree at a US law school as an acceptable substitute for the JD, then apply for admission to practice, get the background check and take the bar exam.
By the way, we have quite a surplus of licensed attorneys in the US at the moment with many recent graduates having difficulty locating positions. Unless you would be coming over from time to time for a foreign firm and not trying to get a work visa and stay in the US, this could be another layer of problems for you to research.

Why does India need a censor board for movies?	"India has a free press and the same freedom applies to cinema, which is free enterprise and outside the control of Government except the Films Division and the Doordarshan, which are aimed at educating and informing the public, while entertaining them. The press in India is free of any control when compared to other countries of the world, and the same applies to cinema. Indian Film Industry is the largest, making over 1250 feature films every year and a much larger number of short films every year. There has always been a lot of discussion over film certification; more so after the censor board issued a list of banned swear words. This drew a lot of ire from the filmmakers that such actions are against the freedom & creative liberty. In this multi-part series on CBFC, we start with taking a look at what CBFC is and how the films are certified.
The Supreme Court in a judgment in 1989 said, ?õ????Film censorship becomes necessary because a film motivates thought and action and assures a high degree of attention and retention as compared to the printed word. The combination of act and speech, sight and sound in semi darkness of the theatre with elimination of all distracting ideas will have a strong impact on the minds of the viewers and can affect emotions. Therefore, it has as much potential for evil as it has for good and has an equal potential to instill or cultivate violent or good behaviour. It cannot be equated with other modes of communication. Censorship by prior restraint is, therefore, not only desirable but also necessary.?õ????
While the media in our country are free, it is considered necessary in the general interest to examine the product when it goes out for public consumption. While there is no certification of published material, need was felt to have certification for films because of the effect that the audio-visual medium can have on the people which can be far stronger than the influence of the printed word, particularly on the impressionable minds of the children. Film certification is thus the end product of the process of previewing of film and it includes a decision either not to allow a particular film or public viewing or to allow it for public viewing with certain deletions and / or modifications or at least proper categorization of the films. Furthermore, it is to ensure that the children do not get exposed to psychologically damaging matter.

Can you be both an introvert and an extrovert?	"I believe this to be true. As I am an example, or at least I think I am.
I took the Briggs Myers 16 personality test a few years ago under a qualified psychologist (in the process of determining a potential path of study). I don't recall the exact percentage allocation the different features, but my result was that I was an ESTJ.
The fact that the test indicated that I was an extrovert stuck in my mind over the years that followed.
I could arrive at a party at immediately keep everyone captivated with conversation. I've never had any issues speaking to strangers, or initiating conversations with senior authority figures, or even public speaking. But at the same time, extended periods around people made me feel drained feeding into the need of wanting to be reclusive. Sitting at home and reading a book or watching a movie felt equally as fun as going out with friends. With the exception of clubbing, which felt uncomfortable due to the overwhelming amount of people all around me.
I had also spoken to friends about this. Whether they thought I was extrovert or an introvert. I found myself getting conflicting results depending on who I spoke to.
I did the personality test again, which once again indicated that I was ESTJ. But this test highlighted that I was 3% more of an extrovert than an introvert.
So yeah, you can be both an introvert and extrovert, merely through displaying characteristics of both personality types.
But yeah, like Quora User mentioned. When discussing introversion and extroversion we are not dealing with binary, variables. Rather uniform variables; where a particular person lies closer to the one, or the other. Or in the middle.

How can a Chinese speak English like a native speaker?	"The good old saying ?õ????practice makes perfect?õ???ù?õ???? I could not even write A-Z when I came to USA in 1986. But I was thrown into full English speaking environment right away and that helped. I also helped out at my family?õ????s liquor store right away and I was forced to pick up English pretty fast. 6 month here I can make some very basic conversations and within 1 year I was semi-fluent.
One great way to learn is to watch your favorite American movies and learn it. Back then I watched Top Gun repeatedly, Back to the Future, Aliens?õ???? etc. these are probably the top 3 movies I?õ????ve seen at least 100 times combined. I try to mimic how the actor/actress say the phrases exactly. Pulp Fiction is another good one to learn from.
Since our liquor store was located in the ?õ????projects?õ???ù area which is very ghetto I also picked up the black ghetto speak and slangs naturally. I can sound like a black person pretty much if I wanted too. Lol lol. To me you just really have to try and enunciate carefully.
Once again, practice makes perfect. First you speak it very slowly and try to be as accurate as possible. Then you slowly say it faster and faster. And the more you embrace the American culture and people faster you blend in. So first of all you have to WANT to speak perfect English then you put in the work.
Trust me, you can do it if you try!! Just put in the work and you will eventually get there.
I speak perfect fluent Mandarin Chinese, English, as well as Taiwanese at the native level. What I meant by that is if I do not disclose everyone thinks I?õ????m native speaker in all three languages. But in fact Taiwanese is what I learned first as I spent lot of time with my grandma as a child and she only spoke Taiwanese.

How can I start dance class in my home?	"Assuming you have enough space for a dance studio?õ???? you hire an experienced balletmaster/mistress and preferably an accompanist and they will take it from there.
Assuming you dont have the money and space to spare for a dance studio you don?õ????t do dance classes at home. There is no video course (free or subscription) that is worth your time. Dance is learned in the company of other people (who are most often just as lost) with a dance teacher who can see what you do.
What you can do at home until you start doing classes is stretch, strengthen your core muscles (pilates is rather good) and learn the dance vocabulary. Learning the dance specific vocabulary will help you understand what the teacher is asking you to do.

What are some good substitutes for baking powder in muffins?	"Baking soda plus cream of tartar or lemon juice will work, but this is only a ?õ????single acting?õ???ù baking powder, and does not provide lift in the oven, only lift in bowl, so be prepared to go quickly from mixing bowl to oven, or suffer less fluffy muffins.
If you want avoid both baking soda and baking powder, you can prepare some yeast per package instructions, and add it to the batter. You should wait about 15?õ????20 minutes after adding the yeast before baking, and it would help to add an extra tablespoon of sugar to your recipe to get the yeast really nice and active. The yeast will put out quite a bit of lift in the oven, so these may be very light and fluffy muffins.

What is a circuit breaker?	"Circuit breakers protect electrical circuits from large current surges. In this lesson, we will discuss different types of circuit breakers and how they work.
Electricity powers an amazing number of the things we use every day, but it can also be dangerous if it gets out of control.
Circuit breakers have to be simple, because they are a major safety measure in common households and in the electrical grid. If no one is around when a circuit gets overloaded, there can sometimes be no other way to prevent a short circuit that could potentially cause a fire. No one wants a circuit breaker that might fail, which is why these mechanisms are based on fundamental laws of physics.
Circuit breaker designs vary; however, most have some standard features. A circuit breaker must be wired in series with one or two of the wires that run throughout a house's electrical system. There is a place for each wire to go in the circuit breaker enclosure as well as to exit the enclosure. In between, inside the circuit breaker enclosure, there needs to be a section of conductor that completes the circuit and is held in place by some force, usually a spring.
The purpose of the circuit breaker is to push the conductor out of contact with the wires leading in and out of the breaker, thereby stopping the flow of electricity. A latching mechanism ensures that the circuit remains broken until an operator (you, for example) comes to reset it and once again pushes the conductor in contact with the rest of the circuit.
In order to push or pull the conductor away and out of contact with the rest of the wiring, the circuit breaker uses one of various types of mechanisms, which are discussed in the following section.
There are two main types of circuit breakers:
Magnetic circuit breakers rely on induction through a coil of wire called a

What do top executives do that employees don't?	"I?õ????ve worked with hundreds of executives in large public companies. The one common thread: they can identify, obtain, and use POWER.
It?õ????s not about execution, emotional intelligence, technical skills, pedigree, etc. Those things help but nothing can substitute for a firm understanding of POWER. POWER is the ability to influence those that can make things happen. If you have POWER, you can make it to the top.
But this is not for the faint of heart.
Identifying sources of POWER is an art. Obtaining POWER is time consuming and self-sacrificing. Using the force of POWER requires emotional distance. You have to be willing to leave bodies (careers) behind. It sounds cliche but it is the truth.

Is it good to do job or to go for btech after pursuing diploma in CS?	"More over it depends upon your own interest and situation. If you want to get further knowledge and specializations now then go for btech. If you want to take a gap year and do experiences in your field then take a job .
Since diploma trains you to be capable of working as a freshmen in the industries, you can pursue job and increase your experience. After doing diploma you can directly continue from 2nd year btech.
However, it is must that you have to do btech and increase your qualification and knowledge sometime in the near future. If you feel like doing it now, go for it.
I also took a year gap after completing highschool in Science. I didn't do job but I did volunteering in the school where I did my schooling. I taught science and maths to grade 8, 9, and 10. I also did other classes and presentations on science stuffs and worked in eca with music. I learned so many things in that 1 year of gap. Gap year gives a pause in your life which helps you to think seriously and consciously about your way of living. You can change yourself in many ways during that period. Now I joint btech in Electronics engineering. I am doing my best and feel good to see myself more committed than my friends. Some of them still don't know their responsibility. For me, gap year was a wonderful time of my life! I feel no regret in it.
So the choice is yours. You can take a gap year and do a job. Or else you can continue btech now. Do whatever you feel profitable. You must be careful to make your gap year very meaningful.
Hope it helps. :)

Is Muhammad of Islam a true prophet?	"Depending on your belief system you may see Muhammad as a true prophet. Christians believe that the last prophet was Jesus Christ so many dislike the idea of claiming Muhammad as a prophet because if they considered him a prophet then their abuse of Muslims would be in vain and quite contradictory. Jews on the other hand do not consider either Jesus Christ or Muhammad as prophets. While, as you should know, Muslims do. So at the end of the day, it all boils down to your faith.

Do animals ever show an interest to mate with humans?	"There are a number of animals that will ?õ????mount?õ???ù a human, as you often see on Youtube videos or one of those ?õ????humorous?õ???ù shows of video clips. Animals like dogs, cats, dolphins, sheep, goats, and even macaques will mount a human, but it is not because they are interested in mating.
There are two reasons that this mounting may occur. The first is dominance behavior?õ????the animal will mount someone they view as submissive and are reinforcing their dominance.
The second reason is sexual stimulation. Even if an animal is neutered, they may still seek sexual gratification and will do so by mounting another of their species, or even their owner. This behavior is seen quite often in the wild, especially among primates and occurs not only between the opposite sex, but many times the same sex. This does not mean they are homosexual as was once thought. They are simply seeking sexual gratification with any willing participant.

It will be scary.

Here?õ????s some of the highlights:
It?õ????s time to GTFOOTW when you can look someone squarely in the eye and tell them in all honesty, ?õ????I think you?õ????ll do a better job at this than I can.?õ???ù
It?õ????s not because you suck. Obviously you don?õ????t suck if you got to this point in a startup. No, it?õ????s because as a founder you?õ????ll have so many things outside your core role to deal with that your attention will be split.
You?õ????ll know this feeling if you?õ????re a startup founder. The feeling of letting everyone down because your schedule got away from you. The feeling when someone has to send you 3 Slack messages, 2 Trello mentions, and an email just to get your approval for a simple change.
As a founder, you are responsible for choosing and training your replacements. You have to make it easy for them to gain the skills and knowledge to do your job. How you do that is up to you, but it starts with understanding what it is you actually do. I, for example, created this Trello board of ?õ???? my job
You can see each card is tagged with different colours. Those correspond to different types of roles within a development team. So, blue is tech stuff and green is leadership stuff.
My goal with this board was to use it Kanban-style to get all of my responsibilities to automated or delegated. I also use it to keep track of experimental processes and to generally not forgot what I?õ????m actually responsible for and what projects I have to spearhead in the future.
If you look in the first column, you?õ????ll also see a card called ?õ????Steal His Job?õ???ù.
Anyone at Crew could access this board and read the various cards and contact me if they wanted to take over a task.
You know all those bad habits and poor choices you made along the way that you?õ????re embarrassed about? Well, get ready to see them in other people as those you?õ????ve trained use your behaviour as an example. You?õ????ll see your behaviour from a brand new outside angle.
?õ????Oh my world, I can?õ????t believe I used to do that.?õ???ù
Fortunately, if you?õ????ve worked on yourself at all, you can guide them out of these habits during the transition phase. ?õ????I really try not to do that anymore,?õ???ù will be your new favourite phrase.
As you help the transition, you may still be in meetings but try not to be too close to the action. The temptation to jump in and control things will be overwhelming. You will have way more information than anyone else at the table?õ????if only because you?õ????ve been doing this longer?õ????but you have to let the new people make their own mistakes and create something of their own.

Is New York City a difficult city to live in? Is it also expensive?	"New York City is certainly expensive. But there are several more expensive cities in the United States.
Interestingly, New York City is very big - about 300 square miles. While Manhattan is dense and expensive, the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and The Bronx are more affordable. And since the New York City subway system covers all of those areas quite well, it is feasible to work in Manhattan and live in less expensive neighborhoods and still have reasonable commutes (where reasonable means less than an hour door-to-door).
On the question of whether it is difficult to live in, the answer is much more equivocal.
If you do not understand how New York works, then it?õ????s hard to live here. You don?õ????t understand where to live, where to shop, how to behave, how to travel, where to find entertainment. If you?õ????re raising children you don?õ????t understand child care, education, or activities for them.
Once you understand how New York City lives and breathes, living here is pretty straightforward. If you?õ????re used to going shopping by driving to the supermarket in your SUV, rolling the loaded shopping cart to your car in the parking lot, parking in your garage at home while you carry the groceries from the car into the pantry, then New York will confuse you, since that?õ????s not how you shop here.
If you visit a New York City apartment and see that the kitchen looks like a narrow hallway and you wonder how you cook with your friends the way you do in the suburbs with your country kitchen, then New York City will confuse you, since that?õ????s not how you cook here.
Anyway, lots of the things that work one way in the suburbs and small cities work differently in New York City. Not necessarily better or worse, but differently. If you think the way you know is the only way and are upset by differences, then you will certainly find New York City to be a difficult place to live.

How can I boost my confidence just 2 days before JEE MAINS?	"The feeling is mutual mate! Sometimes, I feel like I don't know shit and I am not even going to clear the cut off.

Then I say to myself, ?õ????Hey maybe I am not that bad after all?õ???ù.

What are some reviews of Anarkali of Aarah (the 2017 movie)?	"First Published on-
February 26, while surfing YouTube, I came across the trailer of
Cut to March 28, Varun Grover posted a short review about the movie, all praises. And he, I guess is the man I can trust.
March 29, 11:05 PM, PVR Citimall Andheri West. 10 minutes into the movie and a voice inside me told me- ?õ????You sir, will never judge a movie by its trailer again. Specially, when you?õ????ve seen just 20 seconds of it.?õ????
The film has three actors in major roles- Swara Bhasker, Sanjay Mishra and Pankaj Tripathi, who at time and again have proved their mettle. So, let?õ????s talk about the movie before we discuss performances, as they are quite obviously bound to be good.
Coming amidst the glamour that Bollywood is, this movie is silently making its way upward, if not by marketing but by words of mouth at least. For movies like
Set in the rural Bihar, movie tells the story of a community which is marginalised. The people there are empowered and respected as long as they are on the stage but as soon as they leave it, they are being looked down upon.
It is the story of that singer who sings double meaning erotic songs about sexual desires but in no way asking for it. She is just doing her job and her profession is no measure to judge her character. She is not a low hanging fruit and her consent is as important as the consent of your wife or your girlfriend.
Movie wastes no time in justifying Anaarkali?õ????s profession or giving a moral lesson whether it is right or wrong for her to run away to Delhi with a man who practically has no relationship with her. Instead, the movie focuses on making her character so strong that you may feel bad for what happened to her but will not be sympathetic towards her, for all the good reasons. Anaarkali is brave and fighting her battle against power and corruption and giving us the reason to believe that a person who is singing songs about sexual desires has all the rights to fight against sexual harassment.
And it?õ????s not just Anaarkali?õ????s character that is powerful here but the entire cast?õ????s. Pankaj Tripathi as Rangeela is effortless; his timing is as perfect as it can be. Sanjay Mishra as VC is like never before, quite literally. He never lets his image of a comic actor overshadow his negative portrayal here. You instantly hate his character and feel disgusted by it, and as an actor this is the best one can do.
But there is one man, who after all the struggles finally got a role he deserved. Ishteyak Khan as Hiraman; we have seen him in
The movie has earthy music, which is presented as it should be. It is not experimental and is for purists of that art form. In most parts, the songs are picturized in more or less item songs format but without objectification of woman as an item girl. These songs are the soul of the film. Language is another major aspect which makes this movie more authentic.
In the final scene of movie, when Anaarkali storms off of her final performance, carrying the sadness on her face, walking back towards her home; there is this one micro second where realisation hits her. Her expression changes from sad to happy; she is not dragging herself towards her destiny but she is jumping and going for a destination which she will choose for herself. It is her victory and her work is what makes her what she is. She is strong and is not for anyone to be taken for granted.
A lot has been talked about male entitlement and female consent in recent past but what about people for whom provocative dances and explicit words are part of their work? Are they really asking for it? Are they really easy? Is it ok for them to be groped in public? Can you really buy their morale with money? The answer is quite obviously NO. There?õ????s a fine line and
It is probably the best Hindi movie to hit Indian screens in the first quarter of the year but it doesn?õ????t have a big star cast or a masala that Indian audience is obsessed about. And that is the reason movies like this don?õ????t get the screens, audiences and money that they should get. It is the movie that we need but not the one we deserve.
P.S.: Writer-Director Avinash Das continued the recent trend of great movies by debutant directors assuring that future of Indian cinema is in safe hands.

The billboard perfectly expresses existential truths about Donald Trump that are too ugly for most people to face: he is a fascist, he is a self-important, heartless, and greedy man who wholly intends to exploit the American presidency to make himself (and his fascist friends) wealthier than they already are, and the unstable lunatic Donald Trump represents a real threat to world peace and even threatens nuclear holocaust.
There are probably hundreds of questions on Quora asking if Trump is going to start WW3 or use a nuclear weapon. These are the real fears of millions of people.
It is even more important than that.
The billboard is located in the heart of downtown Phoenix. Half of the people who come to downtown Phoenix for government business, including jury duty, will see it. It is on the edge of the predominanly Hispanic side of town - an ever-present reminder for the would be victims of Trump?õ????s savage racism.
As Donald Trump continues to stumble and mismanage his presidency - today the FBI director Comey stuck it up Trump?õ????s ass and broke it off by admitting that the FBI has a formal investigatin of Trump?õ????s Russian Connection - all those people who see that billboard will be reminded that the United States has elected an incompetent maniac comparable to Adolf Hitler.
The billboard will not harm Trump - Trump will continue to fuck up everything he touches and the billboard reminds all patriotic Americans that the American ship of State is in the hands of a lunatic,
Republican Senator Jeff Flake is up for re-election in 2018 - you know that the billboard must give Senator Flake indigestion.
Obviously, Karen Fiorito will do it again - and when she does, the whole world will sit up and pay attention.

If you are an Indian Bengali, most likely you will have no cultural issue. If not , then there will some differences but not that major one. All cultures existing in India has pretty much the same core principles. Get married, get good job, stay with your family.
Next comes religion. If she is Hindu, go ahead get married. No problem at all. I'm almost 95 % sure that her family won't mind ( rest 5% is like my family, lol. Who are not interested letting their kids go that far). But if she is from Muslim family, I would kindly ask you to think twice. Inter religion marriage is still a taboo in our culture and can have serious impact on the couples life.
There are many other variables but I can give you only a generalised idea.
Special cases: if she is from Muslim family who don't follow strictly and lives in city. Then there will less issues . But still there will be issue.

If your lost phone happens to be a smartphone, all three of the major smartphone platform providers (Apple, Google, and Microsoft) now include phone retrieval technology in their smartphones, just in case you ever end up losing it but forget to install a ?õ????find my phone?õ???ù app. Usually, the way these apps work is through the account associated with your device. For Android devices this is your Google account, for iPhones this is your iCloud account, and for Windows Phones this is your Microsoft account. All three allow you to remotely lock and wipe your phone, make it ring, and set up special messages to alert whoever finds it.

What's the most inspiring book in the Bible?	"Oh, oh, I?õ????ve got this one. I?õ????ve got it. I think.
There are many good books in the Bible. It would be terrible to be inspired by some of them, but even those are beautiful in that they hold ancient morals.
But that?õ????s not your question.
I personally believe that the Sermon on the Mount (Mathew chapters 5, 6 and 7) is very inspiring. In it, Jesus explains what he wants from his followers: to ?õ????be like light?õ???ù (He who has a candle does not hide it under his bed. Instead, he makes it shine bright, so that the light is shared), or to be like salt. I believe it to be very inspiring, and entirely devoid of any religious connotations. There is nothing there that requires belief.
There?õ????s also the Book of Wisdom. It is full of, well, wisdom. It reminded me of Meditations of Marc Aurelius and of stoicism. It also holds many proverbs that may be of use.
I would also like to recommend, though not strictly speaking a book in the Bible, the Jefferson Bible. In it, Thomas Jefferson (

"As a sex psychologist, what is your take on homosexuality?"	"Before sitting to write down this answer, I want the reader to now a little background about me and also on the topic of psychology.
When you hear about gays, mostly they come across as people from the socially mobile, well-heeled upper class. (There?õ????s a difference between gays and transvestites, readers, especially Indians should google to know the difference).
When one reaches a particular ladder in social status, sex like food becomes a lot more easily available without any stigma attached. And when one hails from a ?õ????liberated?õ????, first world country, sex seems to become like air and water - freely and abundantly available.
Just like people indulge in food when it becomes so easily and cheaply available, people are bound to indulge in sexual pleasures once it becomes so freely available. This explains my bullet point on food.
So, once when couples freely experiment and do ?õ????that?õ????, girls are bound to experience the gross inadequacy of males. A male, doesn?õ????t last more than 4?õ????5 minutes once he penetrates a female. In 4?õ????5 minutes, a female doesn?õ????t even begin her sexual journey!!
(Do read -
So maybe, after hundreds of such encounters, females in ?õ????liberated?õ???? societies, reach that opinion that they will not get that deep sexual satisfaction from males; in fact their encounters with males would leave them abhorring the very act of sex.
(The male approach to sex is totally selfish, insensitive and grossly inadequate vis-a-vis what a female seeks from the act. The male approach towards sex is bound to leave a bitter after-taste in females.)
Under such circumstances, it is natural for a woman to turn towards other thoroughly disenchanted woman and seek sexual gratification. In sexually ?õ????liberated?õ???? societies, finding one wouldn?õ????t be that difficult.
So, while a woman may be going steady with a male as a wife or girlfriend, the sexually adventurous in a ?õ????free?õ???? atmosphere is bound to indulge with females.
The progeny of such females (preferring females to males) is according to my most humble opinion the origin of gays in such large numbers in the west and in upwardly mobile societies.
P.S. - I put forth this question -

What is the relationship between a slide rule and a computer?	"There is a bit of a relationship.
Both the slide rule and the digital computer operate by analog operations?õ????
In the case of the slide rule, it is the user positioning the slide, then reading off the appropriate number. But the number is indicated by the physical properties of the slide rule. For most things, the slide rule contains numbers marked in a log scale. This allows for things like multiplication by just adding distances. It also (at the same time) allows for addition (different scale, which happens to be linear).
In the digital computer, the digits are in binary - assigned by the designer to voltage/currents. If it is above a given value, it is counted as a 1, if it is below a lower value it is counted as a 0. If the voltage/current is between the two values, it means the circuit either hasn?õ????t stabilized to a high or low value, or is broken?õ???? The switches are actually analog devices, operating very fast. It is up to the designer of the circuits to avoid the unstable values, and ensure that the circuit has enough time to stabilize before the values represented by the voltage is used.
For arithmetic, the bits are combined into groups, with rules for how they can be used (more analog circuits?õ????). In some cases, the numbers represent logarithms. floating values - there is the mantissa represented by a collection of bits, and an exponent (another collection). And additional rules on how to operate on them (yet more circuitry).
The advantage the computer has is that the built in rules may be used in combinations specified by a program. Thus how the numbers are manipulated can be much more complex than what a slide rule can do.

How do American conservatives on Quora handle it when successful military or business persons openly hold liberal views?	"Taxes don't hurt billionaires. Once one is extremely wealthy, whether the government takes 38% or 42% of one?õ????s income is not a noticeable difference in one?õ????s life. (And of course, most of the very wealthy lawyer their way to much lower rates than that).
So when a very financially successful person holds the view that, ?õ????higher tax rates are no big deal. We need to so something about poverty/health care/issue of choice,?õ???ù I am not surprised. It is a free moral decision for them.
I am much more surprised when a small business owner whose gyro shop or dry cleaner or whatever expresses liberal views. They are the ones who are directly hurt by minimum wage increases, or tax increases, or new regulations. In all likelihood they were running the gyro shops at a profit margin that netted them something equivalent to minimum wage already. The new tax and the higher wage requirement will harm their ability to feed their family. So yes, it surprises me when small business people express liberal views.
But Wall Street tycoons? Hollywood moguls? It is no surprise when one of them is liberal. All their incentives lead that way.

Why aren't I getting any interviews for the simplest jobs?	"Hard to say! You may be under qualified over over qualified. Your CV/resume/application may be poorly proofed or may not demonstrate the skills and experience the employer is looking for. You might be using a generic CV tailored for the job you are looking for, etc, etc. There may just be more, better suited candidates.
However there is no such thing as a simple job in my opinion, so if you think you are not getting invites to interview for jobs you feel are the ?õ????simplest?õ???ù, that disdain may come through in your application (that's a lot to infer from a Quora question, so apologies if I got it wrong).
One final constructive comment, if there is an invite to have an informal chat with the employer, always, I repeat always take them up on it. You will find out more about the job and company that will help tailor your application, and they are far more likely to remember you when they see your application.
Good luck!

What is the position of India if still it under Autocracy?		
"Given the mountainous territory of Switzerland, would a Nazi invasion have failed?"	"Ask almost any Swiss person and they will say yes, that Germany could not have taken Switzerland. The Swiss are quite proud of their militia army, and generally assert that had the Nazis attempted to force the passes into their mountain homeland, brave Swiss marksmen using excellent K-31 rifles would have decimated the invaders.
Those assumptions are highly questionable, and certainly Swiss authorities did their utmost to avoid a Nazi invasion by making the country a valuable neutral conduit for Nazi wealth and booty, and thus avoid such a test.
The reality is that the Nazis almost certainly would have been able to overcome the Swiss if they devoted sufficient resources to the task. For example, suppose Hitler decided not to invade the USSR in 1941 and instead decided to take Switzerland? He would have been better off had he done so, no doubt, and it is hard to make a case that the Wehrmacht could not have overcome the Swiss militias regardless of their determination and marksmanship, both of which are probably overrated.
At that time the Nazis not only had hundreds of thousands of tough experienced infantrymen and officers, but several battle hardened mountain divisions too. Plus the Germans would have had total air supremacy in short order.
Finally, consider two other things. One, that the Swiss had not fought a significant military conflict in hundreds of years, and had few if any combat experience soldiers or leaders. Second, that as a largely Germanic country in terms of language and cultural norms, many Swiss would probably not have considered the costs of an all out conflict with Germany worth it, and given up pretty readily.
Outgunned and facing an army full of combat experienced officers and men, not only would Switzerland have fallen, it would have fallen rapidly. It?õ????s conquest probably would not have gone too much differently than Norway?õ????s.

"Despite drastic increase in (cell phone) photos recently, will future generations lose something important due to drastic decrease in printed photos?"	"I think we should keep in mind that photos don?õ????t actually last all that long either. Photos can be destroyed by fire, floods, sunlight and other conditions. Forgive me if this number is inaccurate but I believe its something like 90% of films were lost from the early 20th century. Some of that was because companies recycled reels and the first and second world war (films were melted down for materials for weapons) but a lot were lost to the things that destroy all archival and artifacts. Time and the elements.
It is true that at the moment data storage is not forever and fairly easily corruptible. However, given the progression of technology and some of the new DNA based storage technology that is being developed, that may not always be the case. Consider that the average teenager probably takes more photos during high school then their parents did for the first 30 years of life. There is a lot more data out there. Yes, it can be troublesome to bury that data in the internet, but that will also likely change. It may be in a few years you can, with a simple voice command, pull up data and references from the entirety of your life. I would put much more stock in the survivablilty of the digital stuff for the very long term, assuming of course we don?õ????t destroy humanity, but then it?õ????s unlikely many photos will survive long either.

How do historians view Jesus?	"Different ideologies will give different answers; historians normally work within the era they are studings standards of proof (don't expect DNA testing in Roman records)
Because there's a lot of literature produced 20?õ????30 years after he lived the majority won't say he's fictional, compared to other 1st century Palestinians that's a lot of evidence. Especially if you take the intra-manuscript evidence that some community already existed.
The new testament didn't fall on the church like lightening. And most the early churches didn't use them /have access. It's romanticism to think otherwise. There was an oral tradition of some sorts, and most agree the gospels preserve preaching about Jesus more than historiography.
And it's not like the other sources from that time period are scientific (Josephus talks of mandrake roots killing with screams and using dogs to pull them out?õ????). You can't put our views on other time periods.
Yet. That's the only thing they agree on. There's to much money involved in not agreeing to expect otherwise; to argue that first point risk your achademic reputation, so they leave it alone.

Do you refer to all adults by last name?	"It is not clear whether you mean, ""Hello, Smith"" or ""Hello, Mr Smith"".
In Australia, it is not common to use the title, Mr, Ms, Mrs, Miss, after you have been acquainted with someone for a few weeks, or even on the day you first meet, if both parties agree to use first names.
The exception is formal situations where you are a representative for your company or government department. You would not presume to drop the title, Mr or Ms, etc., on a first meeting until the other person says, call me Dev. Usually, the person with the lesser power will wait to be invited to use first names by the one with more clout (power).
I used to work in a government department and we would always use the title and surname of customers, whether on the phone or in face to face meetings. It was to show respect and to represent the government in a professional manner. However, we would probably call our personal accountant by his or her first name.
Among men in Australia, they sometimes refer it each other just by their last name. ""Hey Dobbs, are you coming to lunch?"" It would be even more common to use a nickname based on his surname: ""Hey, Dobbsy"", ""Hey, Jacko"" (surname Jackson), ""Hey, Robbo"" (surname Robinson or Robertson or Roberts).

What is the best way to travel from Seoul to Beijing?	"3 options:
This involves crossing the most heavily militarized border in the world. Without a special permit from both Korean governments, you?õ????ll have to do this surreptitiously and face the very real risk of getting shot.

Crossing into China, you?õ????ll face the very real risk of getting shot. The overland journey from Liaoning or Jilin to Beijing should however be a relatively pleasant one - relative only to the journey through North Korea.
You?õ????ll travel to Incheon and get a boat to Tianjin. That boat journey costs around US$100 and takes around 25 hours. You?õ????ll get a basic bunk. Very basic. A cruise ship it is not. Tianjin is overall an inoffensive city by Chinese standards and you can continue your journey to Beijing via a very comfortable bullet train in around 45 minutes.
Go to Seoul international airport. Board flight. 1 hour later arrive in Beijing.

Let's say 6 astronauts push themselves away from the ISS while hanging on to the Soyuz. Would they be able to de-orbit?	"Could they deorbit? Definitely yes. Could they deorbit without the help of atmospheric drag, definitely not.
Ignoring atmosphere, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. How much delta-v (change in velocity) is available with a push off. And how much delta-v is required to change the perigee of the orbit from 350 km agl to 0 agl (the definition of deorbit)
I haven't sat down and crunched the numbers but I'm guessing the push off might have a delta-v of 1 m/sec. But you would need a delta-v of something like 100 m/sec to change the perigee by 350 km. So ignoring atmosphere (or my numbers are way off), no, you can't deorbit.
Now considering atmosphere, the answer changes. The ISS is actually constantly deorbiting due to atmospheric drag. It stays in orbit because it does a burn every once in a while. Push off, and you lose the ISS?õ????s future orbit burns. As such, no matter how weak the push off, you will eventually deorbit due to atmospheric drag.

Did King Aerys trust Prince Rhaegar?	"When Aerys was younger and less paranoid, Rhaegar was his heir and he took pride in him. He trusted him.
Unfortunately, Aerys got crazy, and some people helped to fill his ear with negativity. Varys was no friend to Rhaegar and whispered into the king?õ????s ear about Rhaegar. Tywin had nothing against Rhaegar, but he wanted Cersei to marry him, and Aerys refused in such a way, that he made Tywin feel like the hired help instead of the Hand who repeatedly helped his kingdom grow, sometimes through his own resources. Aerys got more paranoid after he was captured at Duskendale. Tywin helped to release him and punish the culprits, but Aerys never trusted the people who truly could help him after that. Rhaegar was one of those people.
Toward the end, Aerys was overly protective of Viserys as he had lost a lot of children and he needed another son in case Rhaegar died or turned traitor. Interestingly enough, Rhaegar had no such intention until it became apparent to him with Robert?õ????s Rebellion that he needed to address his father?õ????s growing inability to rule. Jaime knew this as he admitted as much to him when he left for battle. So it depends on the King Aerys II to which you refer. The younger king trusted his heir. The older one did not. And if Rhaegar had lived, he may have taken over the kingdom with the support of the smallfolk, Dorne (Aerys basically held Elia as a hostage to ensure that Dorne would help in the war), the Hightowers, the Tyrells and possibly Tywin if Rhaegar had made sure it was worth his while.

Don't you think that rich Dalits using reservations takes away the opportunity of poor Dalits who actually need the reservations?	"As @Quora User rightly pointed, the argument that rich, creme de la creme Dalits grab the opportunities that should rightly go to Dalits from impoverished families is skewed.
This is a baiting question by someone who is definitely anti-reservation, aimed at garnering provocative and jingoistic responses. A person from the upper caste worrying about poor Dalits being denied the opportunity by ?õ????rich?õ???ù Dalits reminds of a saying in Tamil which goes like (I'm paraphrasing) ?õ????The wolf worrying over the rain-drenched sheep?õ???ù.
Over 95% of Dalits still remain in poverty. It's easy for someone who is not Dalit to pretend that Dalits enjoy all the benefits of Reservation and are coming up in the society to the point where they are all-powerful. The ground reality still remains pathetic. In the single window system in Tamil Nadu, all the general category and OBC seats for premier institutes get filled up in the first day. The SC/ST quota remains unoccupied for days.
This is one of the ugly faces of India. In fact, calling this the ugliest side of India isn't an exaggeration.
I happened to have a heated discussion with a friend (a caste Hindu from Uttar Pradesh) about exactly the same topic. No matter what facts and statistics I presented, he would not give up his stand. He said that even if one Dalit from a well-to-do family is given the benefits reservation, it's a chance denied to a ?õ????deserving?õ???ù Dalit. Indeed, anti-reservationists like to twist and turn the definition of ?õ????deserving?õ???ù as it suits them. You can't wake a man up, when he is only pretending to be asleep
For millennia they were discriminated with the aid of every possible tool at our disposal and now you cry foul? From our scriptures (that our ?õ????wise and holy ancestors?õ???ù wrote) to sources of drinking water and creamtoriums and burial grounds, they are still discriminated. We wash the whole temple when a Dalit visits it. Dalit students are still being forced to do menial tasks at schools by their ?õ????inherently wise?õ???ù teachers. They live in utterly squalid hostels if they are lucky. If they are not lucky, which most of them are, then it's a hut on the banks of some ditch of a river. And you cry foul? There are well known cases of Dalits in government service being targeted and harassed and denied promotions and awarded humiliation. And you cry foul?
If you think they do not deserve reservation, they did not deserve discrimination and inhumane treatment too. You thought they were lesser men to even get the bottom place in your ?õ????Varna?õ???ù. Now, they will have this reservation.

The reason the Chinese government blocks Western social media is that they are worried that someone will use Facebook to tell 10000 people to come to a square at a certain time and protest. Also if the Chinese government asks Facebook to remove a post asking 10000 people to come to a square at a certain time, Facebook won?õ????t.
It also works the other way. If the government can get access to your social media network, they can very quickly identify who may be a ?õ????problem.?õ???ù If someone posts anti-government information, and the government has access to social media, then they can very quickly find out who their ?õ????friends?õ???ù are, and how much threat they are to the system and then figure out what to do about it. It turns out that all of the Chinese media companies will turn over all of their information to the Chinese government, but none of the Western companies will.
The Chinese internet is in fact flourishing, but it?õ????s tightly controlled so that you really can?õ????t use it to organize against the Chinese government. If you post on Wechat a message to gather on a square, it will get deleted, and the Chinese government will know who all your friends are.

It occurs to me that humans are the only social species for which socialism is not essential. is that true?	"Once upon a time, it
The survival of the individuals was incredibly dependant on the survival of the tribe and your peers. If your fellow tribesman was in trouble, you helped him out because if he dies then your tribe is weaker for it and it reduces your chance of survival. This still survives today to an extent, especially when you remove humans from the pleasures of modern society and force them into an unknown situation to survive. Cooperation itself becomes natural in times of uncertainty or unrest.
Even in civilisation this is true, in times of war or imminent danger, humans can put aside differences in order to solve the problem. On the flip-side, in times of chaos, humans will cling to the strongest group that promises hope and order.
So we know there is a degree of social cooperation built into our own psyche to this day. In fact, one might say that social cooperation is essential to humans who naturally group themselves by similarities and assimilate into groups. We?õ????re even more productive when positively motivated for the group or feel like our purpose to the ?õ????group?õ???? or social order is important. Many humans in effect, can be motivated simply by positive reinforcement or feeling like they have greater purpose - much of these ideas have gone on to be used int he workplace today alongside monetary incentives to improve workplace conditions and productivity.
We?õ????ve retained many tendencies to social cooperation as a species even though our society has become more individualistic. We see remnants of our social psychology in the way we act as a species and cooperate. Of course, this diminution in
Our society has allowed to us to be individual by separating labour from their own product and increasing abundance to the point where we no longer need to care who is supplying our water, we just get what we pay for.
Social cooperation still survives though of course, unfortunately, a system like capitalism discourages altruism and punishes those who are
The existence of herd behavior in humans shows us that despite how much we want to believe humans are individualistic and selfish, we are ultimately bound by our own nature to want to belong to a bigger group. To need to have a place in society despite also needing individual boundaries and freedoms.
The part we need to understand in modern society is where can we strike a good balance between social cooperation in economic policy and egoism. How can we use our social nature as a species to improve society for more people whilst allowing the natural law of individualism?

What is the biggest mind blow ever?	"Most people think the more choices and freedom we have, the happier we are. But
Just imagine what would happen if Apple actually launches 100 different models of iPhone in a year. The sales will definitely drop, why? Because there are too many models to choose, it makes it incredibly hard to make a decision and actually picks one.
The problem of it is not about the iPhone?õ????s quality here, but the hassle customers need to go through to make the right choice. The more choice we have, the harder for us to choose. And most people will simply walk away due to the difficulty in making a decision.
The best example is a big majority of startup failures. Most startup failures aren?õ????t caused by the lack of resources or market size, but the lack of focus of the founding team. Smart people with great ideas and endless resources have more choice, which is not always a good thing. In this case, more choice produces procrastination and distractions to focus on the most important matters at the moment.
Now, you have 5 oranges to choose from, one of them is the best orange you will ever have in this world. And this is the only chance for you to have that, if you miss it, you will never be able to get your hand on the world?õ????s tastiest orange in your lifetime ever. How is that make you feel?
More choice produces higher expectation to each and every option you have. We now know there is a world?õ????s tastiest orange out of the five, but our brain will assume all the five are the tastiest. Even if we don?õ????t think so, rationally and logically, we assume we will pick the tastiest one, and we can?õ????t accept anything less than that.
But even if you?õ????re incredibly lucky to pick the best, you might think it?õ????s not perfect, because you can never know how the other four oranges taste like. The opportunity cost of the other oranges leads to dissatisfaction in us. This happened a lot in many areas of our life. Some people will think their spouse is not the best because there is always a better one, even their spouse is actually the best for them.

In an experiment published in 1960, English psychologist Peter Wason challenged participants to identify a rule applying to triples of numbers. In the experiment, the participants were told that ?õ???? 2, 4, 6 ?õ???? fits the rule. Participants then could generate their own triples and the experimenter told them whether or not each triple conformed to the rule.
When the participant came up with 3, 5, 7, the experimenter then told the triples to fit the rule. Then, the participants would need to come up with the rule of the triples.
It didn?õ????t matter if the rule was wrong, the participants were free to come up with another triple to collect more information in assisting them to identify the rule.
While the actual rule was simply ?õ????any ascending sequence?õ???ù, the participants are facing great difficulty in identifying it. Often, the participants came up with rules that were far more specific, such as ?õ????The last number is the multiple of the first two numbers?õ???ù.
The participants seemed to test only positive examples ?õ???? triples that obeyed their hypothesized rule. For example, if they thought the rule was, ?õ????Each number is four greater than its predecessor?õ???ù, they would offer a triple that fit this rule, such as (11,15,19) rather than a triple that violates it, such as (11,12,17).
That?õ????s what Peter Wason coined this finding with the term ?õ????
We open our eyes to more positive examples that strengthen the belief but tend to ignore everything else that disprove and violate it. We no longer perceive the circumstances objectively. In fact, we pick only a part of the data that make us feel good because it supports our prejudices.

What are best reality checks for lucid dreaming?	"Unfortunately, most brains are so ?õ???ùconformed?õ???ù to the laws of the dream that there are?ˇ only a few cases in which you are allowed to ask yourself if you are in a dream. You may notice strange things in the dream, unusual elements and physics, but, as your brain will rarely think if it is a dream or not, you will mostly accept the strange rules.
However, if your brain allows you to put yourself this question, here are a few things you can do.
If you are in a dream where you are able to modify objects and reactions, try changing the shape, the color or another element of something. This should be a coherent proof that you are actually dreaming, because you cannot do such things in the real world.
If you are in a dream where you can change the plot, like a movie producer, change it to something that is not natural in normal circumstances. For example, make a bird fly backwards, make the enemy attacking you suddenly befriend you or get lost. This power that only a deity could have is another good proof that you are dreaming.
And, the most effective way is to think: ?õ???ùWhere did I come from? What happened before this day/ moment??õ???ù. You will be able to reconstruct the memories of some previous actions, but you will notice that you will not be able to remember the past day, the past week or month, because they have never existed in your dream (assuming that you dream the events during a single day). In the real world, you are always able to remember the past. In a dream, it is a limited ability. This is the best way to check if you are dreaming or not.

"My boyfriend dumped me because I am not like other girls, who wear makeup and fashionable clothes. What should I do?"	"You should realize that someone who doesn?õ????t appreciate you for you, and what you like to wear and look like, is the wrong person to be with.
Someone who is a good partner is someone who appreciates you for who you are, and not who he wants you to be. They support your choices, regardless of whether they approve of them or not.
Believe me, he does not seem like a good person for you to be around, and I would strongly suggest not making any repair attempts.
Be you. Do what you enjoy and what makes you happy. If that means wearing brown sweaters and no makeup, than why not? If that means staying in all day, than more power to you. And stay away from any guy who tries to shape you into his ideal, rather than holding up who you already are as an ideal.

Is anal masturbation at 13 okay?	"Yes, it is okay! However, you must be sure that you are clean inside first. Use an enema bag filled only with warm water to clean yourself out. Repeat until clean. You must also use a lot of lubrication. Use only a water based lube intended for personal sexual use. When starting out, use a smaller dildo about the same size as your erect penis, then increase the size when you are ready. When performed with with the above precautions, anal masturbation is awesome!

Why do we see so much of power games in relationships today?	"It's really a breakdown in Communication. It only takes one act of indifference or a deliberate act of sudden pride and ego for not having to ?õ????earn?õ???ù each other's love.
?õ????He loves me and I don't have to fawn over him or show appreciation anymore?õ???ù
That's either sparks hm to try harder to earn the affections an even more rigid and indifferent GF. Either that or get bitter and retaliate in kind. Regardless,it's like knitting a sweater with just the left needle on the left side of the weather and the right needle on the right. Nothing comes together and the whole thing falls apart
People don't realize that every form of emotional and informational connectivity is what compromise of the fabric of a relationship. Consciously not being in tune with one on another emotional level is not only deliberate sabotage of the relationship, it's almost act betrayal. Nobody should EVER proactively chose indifference to their BF?õ????S love due to pre-emotive self preservation or security . Would you do that to your best friend? You already do it to your parents, who provided you with LIFE.
It's ironic if not tragic why people test the most important people in their lives worse than they do acquaintances.
In the end, people only deserve what they are willing to dish out. If you want to be callous to your BF, that's what will your BF will become (and vice versa)
One Day your friend might find someone she really loves and then regret losing him. She will realize what's she did to a. Good and loving BF and make chanages. If she continues to get burned herself, she may end up a Jerry Springer tragedy

"Which will go to an SN2 reaction faster, allylic halide or 3-degree halide?"	"Obviously, allyl halide undergo faster SN2 rxn than that of tertiary alkyl halide. The reason is simple. SN2 rxn is concerted/single step where back side attack of nucleophile occur that means nucleophile attack to the reacting C-centre 180???¯ away from the leaving group (?õ????L).
That's why, in case of SN2 rxn of 3???¯alkyl halide, upcoming nucleophile will face a high amount of steric hindrance and so, the corresponding, T.S. will become highly sterically crowded;lead the rate very slow?õ???? Actually in this case SN2 rxn is almost impossible : if, nucleophile has any basic character, Elimination rxn. may take place.
Now, in case of allyl halide, the rate of SN2 rxn. is much more faster than expected. First of all, the reacting C-centre is 1???¯ and most importantly, during the SN2 rxn, the T.S. become highly stable bcz of the some sort of electronic interaction occur between the allylic ?è??-bond (HOMO) and sigma* orbital (LUMO) of C?õ????X & C?õ????Nu (nucleophile)?õ????. So, I hope my explanation make my above statement clear and well support my answer.

What is it like to have a young child with a mental illness?	"I felt guilty, hopeless, angry, very tired, and sad. It was hard to get along with my husband. I didn?õ????t have the energy to live a normal life or friendships. One counselor pointed out that our family had been operating on an emergency basis for years. Support groups and counselors helped.
There?õ????s a wide range of problems in early childhood that can qualify as ?õ????mental illness.?õ???ù
One of our children had a problem early on, and we took her to a pediatric psychiatrist who worked wonders in three visits. Our daughter was going to start fourth grade in the fall, and was very anxious about having a new teacher. She started worrying about this on the first day of summer vacation, three months ahead of time. She was obsessed with it. Her worry was not abnormal, but the amount of anxiety she had was abnormal.
This child developed clinical depression as an adolescent. Counselors helped temporarily, but eventually she became psychotic as a young adult, and had to be treated as an inpatient. This treatment was successful. She?õ????s now an adult and doing well.
Children at either end of the IQ scale are at increased risk for developing addictions, as are creative children. I?õ????m familiar with one boy who started drinking in sixth grade. Watch for it. These kids are miserable because of their mental illness, and use drugs to medicate themselves.
Sometimes a child?õ????s behavior is an exaggeration of normal behavior, rather than a sudden new behavior. An example would be our daughter worrying three months ahead of time about her new teacher. Bipolar would be an example, since everybody has good and bad days, but the swings would be more extreme. Hearing voices, though, would be an immediate warning sign that something is obviously wrong.
If you go to a counselor, be aware that it?õ????s possible for a good counselor to be a bad ?õ????match?õ???ù for a child. Often the counselor will be the one who realizes it, and will recommend somebody else who would be a better fit.
The mental illness is not your fault, but you can help your child by lowering the amount of stress in your home. A family counselor or support group can help parents locate areas of stress, and suggest ways to make living with each other easier.
Psychiatric medication is a relatively recent development. One medication may be used for more than one illness, so you can?õ????t compare medicines with someone else. Each case is different, just as each person is different. A doctor may have to experiment with different medications to treat your child. This is a long process, since medications cannot be abruptly discontinued. Your child would be weaned off the current medication in a number of weeks to be sure that it is gone from their body. Then a new medicine would be instituted and the dose of it gradually increased for a few weeks while the doctor watches carefully for improvement and for side effects.
Don?õ????t let anybody tell you that you are bad parents, and it?õ????s all your fault. It isn?õ????t!

What can a woman do to increase her sex drive?	"About 5 years ago my sex drive was non-existent.
There were several changes that I made, some I would recommend, some I wouldn't advise before seeing a doctor.
I was overweight, nearly 300lbs leading to a poor body image and further increasing my depression. I began spending more time outdoors, that alone helped improve my mood. I began hiking, and had more energy and lost weight, 120lbs. The weight loss and feeling better about myself helped significantly. This I would recommend, even if she is not overweight. Spending time outdoors does wonders, at least it did for me.
I was also on hormonal birth control. I have never done well on birth control at all, it always has caused me problems. I quit taking my birth control and my libido changed drastically. Of course this isn't a solution for, nor would I reccomend it to everyone. To prevent pregnancy I had a tubal ligation. (Which I regret) Yes, it helped my libido, but it definitely isn't a choice for everyone.
My libido dropped again two years ago after I began taking antidepressants to manage my depression and anxiety. I enjoy sex, and it frustrated me to have no sex drive. I was more depressed than I was before because of this, and so I decided to stop taking my meds.
Age could also be a factor. Estrogen levels drop during the transition to menopause. This can cause decreased interest in sex and dryer vaginal tissues, resulting in painful or uncomfortable sex. If she is approaching menopause low estrogen levels could be to blame for her low libido. She could also have a hormonal imbalance. Once again, this is something she should see a doctor for.
Alcohol or Smoking could be a factor as well. I used to drink 2?õ????3 times a week, 5 or more drinks in one night. This contributed to my depression and weight gain, and I am sure affected my libido as well. I don't drink anymore, at all. My sex drive now, between weight loss, eating right, spending more time outdoors and just living a healthier lifestyle altogether, is the highest it has ever been. I have gone from not wanting sex, to feeling like I don't have sex enough.
Yes, stress does contribute as well. If you don't already have a ?õ????date night?õ???? I suggest doing so! If you have children, try to find a babysitter and just spend one night a week, or every other week doing something together. My husband and I try to have a ?õ????date night?õ???? every week. Sometimes we go out for dinner, sometimes we take a walk in the park, other times we have just browsed in the book store, and got some coffee, and sat down while I read poetry books to him. That bonding has brought us closer together. 99% of the time our date nights end with sex. These are normally stress free nights, and we both benifit from them.
I hope my answer is helpful.

"Is it OK to get back together with your ex, even if he did hurt you at first place?"	"After a 17 year estrangement from my first love, my first husband ?õ????. we reconnected 5 months ago and after a month of platonic friendship we got back together again.
It was absolutely WONDERFUL at first, but then the cracks started to appear after two months.
I had remarried and had children, he had not. He had barely repartnered in 17 years and had lived a completely selfish life without children or a partner.
I have grown and matured in the way you should by your 40s - he is still like a selfish 22 year old in most ways.
All of the maturing I thought he?õ????d done, and the forgiveness I thought I had for him cheating on me once (20 years ago) ?õ???? started to crumble once he started getting secure and confident with me and he started showing his true self again.
It was the same selfish, high maintenance, petulant guy that I had left 17 years earlier.
The chemistry between us physically is still amazing, and we both look quite young and unchanged which made it super easy to go back into, but the selfishness in his core is unchanged.
If our relationship could be 95% bedroom I?õ????d never leave but the problem is, sex can only make up a percentage of your week and you?õ????ve got to get along and be happy for hours outside the bedroom ! It doesn?õ????t matter how incredible and intimate the sex is, he still pisses me off the minute we leave that bed.
I had a moment a month ago where I said something he didn?õ????t like (he had been caught out by me fudging the truth ?õ???? again) and he turned on his heel and stormed off on me in the middle of a busy street.
Now 20 years ago I would have run after him, tried to talk to him, cajole him out of his petulance ?õ???? but the grown up me just thought ?õ????screw this, I don?õ????t need this crap?õ????.
I don?õ????t have the patience or the time for arguments, dramas and makeup sex in my 40s. I?õ????m past it.
I watched him walk off, I went and sat down on a street bench and I started checking emails and replying to texts. I gave him 5 minutes in my mind and decided I would go to my car and drive home with or without him.
Interestingly he came back as he instinctively knew he?õ????d pushed me too far and he wasn?õ????t getting the same old response. He nailed the final nail in his coffin that night when he threw that tantrum.
There are many other things that have happened but I can see the same relationship forming from when we were young - him playing the high maintenance, selfish guy who knows I am sexually weak for him, me the selfless woman who makes him feel wonderful and special and forgives him over and over because he is sexy and flashes the pretty boy eyes at me and all is forgiven.
Nup. Not again.
I have told him we?õ????re not going to work but it was beautiful to reconnect albeit briefly and I?õ????ve walked away.
I had high hopes in spite of people saying NO WAY ?õ???? don?õ????t take back a cheating ex who treated you badly once before.
I don?õ????t believe he would ever cheat again as he genuinely seems to love me and know what he lost but the selfishness and tendency to minimise and tell lies are a deal breaker for me.

Do you want a Quora in Chinese?	"No! I would quit writing here ASAP if there were a Chinese version of quora.
I stay here because I like the stability and strict regulations of this global community.
I was bashed by a Chinese student (Let?õ????s call him A) in Britain because he thought the experience I wrote about my student in a British public school was not real. I couldn?õ????t understand why he used dirty languages to attack me simply because of this trivial matter.
And another Chinese student (let?õ????s call him B) thought that the usage of ?õ????influence?õ???ù I mentioned in one of my post is incorrect, and therefore he not only answered the same question sneering at my ?õ????mistake?õ???ù and asked me to fight against him in the private message, but also followed me to another question I raised (irrelevant to English) to post the same thing again after he found that I deleted the original post and didn?õ????t react to his invitation to argue with him. (I didn?õ????t think it?õ????s worth my time)
Zhihu is now inundated with mainland students, some of whom are not that diligent and tend to vent their frustration from their studies and life on the strangers they encountered on the Internet.
This is aweful because I have a career and I am an adult, so I basically have no time or any intention to play this game with them.
Take B as an example. I checked his profile and found that he has two problems:
Obviously, this kind of person can devote himself to making you nuts on the Internet, when you have to focus on your career, he doesn?õ????t.
He is idling away his life since he doesn?õ????t know which discipline to pursue in the college. So, he needs a target!
How about A? He avoided having direct communication with me after I asked him to apologize for calling me a loser ( ?ù?ß???????????¨??and a liar (???¶???ù???ê???¨??, while posting a large number of pictures showing how great he was.
This was one of the articles he posted to show his great achievement in British political arena, according to which he pleaded for an scrutinization of gender equality in the A-level test in a website called
The last sentence from this article shocked me, which says that his appeal has created a huge sensation in both the UK and the US. And this author hopes that he?õ????d run for the Prime Minister in the future. ???¨??The disclaimer in this article claims that this article is written by the authors who registered in this website and therefore it will not be held accountable for the statements in these articles. I seriously doubt if it?õ????s written by A himself or an author hired by his rich family)
Oh, he also posted his pictures of attending a BBC show called ?õ????Global Philosopher?õ???ù as an average audience and the picture of former Prime Minister as if they were having a dialogue(I saw the video later and they were not!)
Opps!
After the aforementioned incidents, I posted an answer claiming that I?õ????d stop writing anything on Zhihu, which begins to make me feel as if I were in a mental hospital. See, I don?õ????t read post that I?õ????ve written, but A (or someone eles) tried to add me in wechat and asked me to have a fight with those British Chinese students. B private messaged me to read his post and have a fight. His original message was ?õ???????ù?ù???????????¨?ù?ê???õ???ù. (meaning: Come and fight with me)
These behaviours are unbelieve and unacceptable to me, which reminds me of the red guards in the Cultural Revolution.(Sorry, but I just can?õ????t get it. Why Chinese are so much into internal conflicts which can yield NOTHING)
Look at how those people enjoyed attacking a stranger. Notice what the girl said about me. She showed her support for A and called me a moron (?ù???Ø?????¨???¨??because she thought that I have never been abroad and am not qualified to answer anything related to the UK.
I reported her to the admin, after which her comment on me was deleted, but her account wasn?õ????t banned or punished for her foul language.
A was not punished until I emailed the admin twice and found their phone number in Beijing to call them directly.
What did he get from demeaning others?
He was banned for only ONE day.
I?õ????m not the kind of person who is into useless fight against strangers, especially the lunatic fringe who aims at becoming the Prime Minister of the UK as a Chinese born in mainland China.
Oh, I disabled the comments. I guess you all know why. :D
Give me a break, I just wanna have a good time after work and exercise in the gym. I?õ????m not into debating,debating and debating with Chinese men.

Is being a psychologist considered more prestigious than being a social worker?	"If Prestige is what you seek and concern then this field will not be the cup of tea.
Prestige is only relative to The Eye of the person wielding it and the people outside who perceive it. Think for a second, a stranger may feel that the job describe above is prestigious as it is a noble profession albiet the Long gruelling hours and being underpaid. On the other hand, it is that con that one will not believe it is prestigious.
In any case, both jobs are perhaps prestigious relative to the fact that they are noble and important professional important to improving, uplifting and empowering many different type of community.
Both profession require specialised education in Psy or SW and many professional possesses a master specialising in a certain skill set or therapy styles such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy.
However if there is a different would PROBABLY be the fact that SW in a community setting would handle more general cases such as financial to divorce compared to Psychologists who are tasked with more complex cases involving psychoemotional issues. Ultimately, the question then will be what is your career objective? To be a generalist or a specialist?

Pakistan is like a Knife in India?õ????s back and whoever wants to annoy India just hold?õ????s it firmer and use it to bleed India.
And, the knife (Pakistan) is always eager to rent itself out to do it?õ????s gig as a tool to annoy India. First it was rented out by USA and West and now China is using it.
A good parting gift by Colonial British indeed which reminds us our History and how our overrated leaders of those times Screwed up and played at hands of the colonizers. A big percentage of India?õ????s problems are legacy of British and our so called founding fathers.
I hope in future we set the history correct in full perspective with more objectivity. We should totally expose the over rated leaders in our History who were just bunch of low intellect subservient individuals who are unnecessarily lionized in our History books.

"Now that they no longer need to hold their tongues, what did Democrats really think of Hillary Clinton?"	"I supported Hillary before the election, but I?õ????m not upset that she lost.
With news that Hillary earned nearly three million more votes than Donald Trump, there was a lot of talk about Hillary being the ?õ????people?õ????s candidate,?õ???ù as opposed to Trump who won because of the antiquated electoral college.
But for all this talk about her being the ?õ????people?õ????s choice,?õ???ù she wasn?õ????t. She was never the people?õ????s choice. Americans - and particularly American democrats - never really had a choice with her.
As Slate Magazine put it,
She?õ????s been a central figure in the Democratic Party since 1992. It was supposed to be her turn in 2008, but she lost to Obama. This year was definitely, absolutely, 100 percent her turn.

And when a plausible alternative surfaced (Bernie Sanders), the conspirators did what they were expected to do. The media labelled him a fringe candidate. Economists wrote off his plans as ?õ????
All of this leads to the most jarring political graphic in recent American history.
This was not a victory for American liberalism, or for feminism, or any socially progressive cause at all. This was a victory for the ?õ????establishment?õ???ù that propped her up, with all their efforts, as high as they did; that colluded for her to reach these heights by suppressing all reasonable chances for an alternative.
And it?õ????s incredible to me that Hillary could be so tone deaf.
I have no doubt a Trump presidency will be mired with controversy, corruption, and scandal - possibly worse depending on the consequences of his foreign policy. But what was historic about his electoral upset was that it was a victory against the media conglomerates. It was a victory against the globalists. It was a victory against the investment bankers and hedge fund managers. It was a victory against the political unionists. It was a victory against corporate multinationals. Clinton had all their support from the beginning. And she lost.

Why do all SIM services except BSNL provide unlimited prepaid offers for 4G mobiles?

For decades this department has been in big loss that?õ????s why (to reduce the deficit), Company does not reduce price or offer any free SIM Card or service.
Jio introduced VoIP 4G service in India(first time) and offered free service for first three months to make maximum number of customer. Their initial target was 100 million/ 10 crores. They extended free service for another 3 months and achieved this target. Now, that offer is going to expire on 31 March but this service can be continued for another one year with a very nominal charges. This new plan is known as Jio Prime Membership.
To get this benefit, customer have to register @rs.99 and continue this plan @Rs 303/month. They also offers other attractive plan that is cheaper than others. Best part of Jio service is that you have to pay only for one thing call or data. If you are taking voice call plan then data is free. If you take data plan voice call is free. Their plan is 10 time cheaper than others. To compete with Jio other telecom company have to offer free service. Small companies like Aircel, Telenor, Idea are merging or tie up with R com, Airtel and Bodafone.

What are three big differences between the movie and book of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix?	"The one which most strikes me is how they?õ????ve changed Snape and made his behaviour over the Occlumency lessons seem unfair.

In the book, Snape invades Harry?õ????s mind during the Occlumency lessons, and when Harry turns the tables on him and reads Snape?õ????s childhood memories Snape praises him and becomes considerably more friendly than he usually is - almost chatty.
However, on a subsequent occasion Snape is called away to care for an injured Slytherin, and while he is gone Harry looks in the Pensieve into which Snape has placed some memories he doesn?õ????t wish Harry to see - equivalent to reading Snape?õ????s diary behind his back. Harry knows that Voldemort may at any moment look out through his eyes and see what he sees, and he knows that whatever Snape has placed in the bowl must be sensitive information, but he looks anyway - proving he can?õ????t be trusted and that working with him puts Snape in great danger. He also (accidentally) humiliates Snape by witnessing the bullying incident, and Snape is bound to expect that Harry will share it with his friends and jeer at him. It is at this point that Snape refuses to go on teaching him Occlumency.

If the tension is doubled, it will most likely break. The speed of sound, remains the same. If the string doesn't break then the original frequency of the string, will increase and is typically double the Hz.

Why do some people say to let aspirin dissolve in your mouth instead of chewing it and swallowing it when you are having a heart attack?	"The advice for a heart attack patient is to CHEW an aspirin tablet. This is because there is buccal absorption of Aspirin and hence the effect will be much faster. In a heart attack, time is of the essence - and every minute counts. Once absorbed, it reaches the blood stream and heart almost immediately. Oral aspirin when given as a tablet, takes longer to be absorbed and then it has to go to the liver, and then only enter the systemic circulation.
Enteric coated aspirin should never be used in such a situation, unless it is crushed and then kept in the mouth for some time.

How do astronomers guess the age of a star?	"I was so curious for getting an answer to this question. After doing some research on net and through journals, finally I got it.
Defining the age of a star has been an ongoing challenge within astronomy and astrophysics but it holds great importance as it allows us to establish the to study the evolution of the Milky Way galaxy and to understand stellar evolution and star cluster evolution. The only fundamental stellar age we have is that of the Sun, which is derived from radioactive dating of meteorites. There are many available techniques present today that allow for stellar age dating, all of which rely heavily on models or empirical relative calibration. One of the most commonly used methods by astronomers today is the fitting of single stellar age, or isochrones model fitting.
As noted, the one and only fundamental age in stellar astrophysics is that of the Sun, based on measuring abundances and daughter products of radioactive nuclides in meteoritic material. Similar nuclide abundances can be measured in the spectra of stars, but without full knowledge of all the nuclides involved some critical assumptions must be made. Those assumptions appear to be rea- sonably sound on both theoretical and practical grounds, leading to the ???™?Årst semi-fundamental technique, nucleocosmochronometry.
Nucleocosmochronometry derives stellar ages by measuring the decay of long- lived isotopes. One seeks an isotope with a half-life comparable to the age of the object under study so that a measurable quantity remains; the isotope must o???™??er detectable features; and the element?õ????s abundance should be dominated by that isotope. The decay of these isotopes involves fully understood physical pro- cesses. However, an initial abundance for the elements must be assumed because it cannot be measured directly. This is ordinarily done by scaling from other r-process abundances and assuming production ratios of the elements being mea- sured. There remains signi???™?Åcant uncertainty in these steps. Di???™??erent calculations can lead to production ratios that di???™??er by nearly a factor of two.
Astronomers will make a model, applying all applicable physical laws, such as the ideal gas laws, gravity, and the like. Models can then be fast-forwarded to any point in time, and then checked against observations and refined.
So let?õ????s start by taking a look at a basic isochrone. The above image shows a typical H-R diagram with hot, blue stars to the left, and cool red stars to the right. Going diagonally from the upper left to the lower right, we can see a large section of the main sequence. Branching off from that are three trails which represent the distribution of stars after 10^8, 10^9 and 10^10 years. What we learn from this is that, as this conglomeration of stars ages, stars will ?õ????peel off?õ???ù the main sequence, starting with the massive stars in the upper left. The turn off will then work its way down the main sequence with the path it takes from there changing as it does.
That?õ????s all well and good of course, but now how to test this aspect of the models? To apply some data to these, we need a large number of stars that all formed at very nearly the same time, but at a variety of different masses. Fortunately, nature provides a wonderful opportunity to find just such things: clusters.
Clusters form from a single cloud so the chemical composition is the same for all stars involved. The formation occurs relatively quickly in astronomical time scales, so now we have everything we need to be able to see if models can accurately reproduce the observed shape that nature creates.

Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas..this movie has big stars and it was one of the best vampire movie I have ever seen. Definetly worth to watch.

Great perfect gorgeous movie. A movie from Iran. Even though all the limitations they have, Iranians do greatmovies and they are really good at it. This is my favourite with the ?õ????Only Lovers Left Alive?õ???ù. Black-white, Independent, modern vampire movie.
I prefer vampire movies with art. Visual scenes are important for me which the colours and shapes in great harmony. Soundtrack is another thing but in this list there is example without music it can made great ones too. So simply speaking, I hate action based vampire movies, but there must be good quotes and visual concept. You can also add ?õ????The Addiction (1995)?õ???ù to this list.

Can I go ahead to learn ethical hacking with basic/no programming knowledge?	"In short, the answer is yes. You can definitely start ethical hacking tutorials without any programming experience. You can pick up all you need to know along the way. However,?ˇ your chances of success will be much lower than someone who already knows how to program.
The reason for this isn't that it's impossible. It's just that without programming experience, you'll need more perseverance to make it through hacking tutorials. Most good hacking tutorials will have some sort of war game, where you need to break into / accomplish some task on a system that has been set up specifically for the tutorial. War games usually have minimal hints and will require knowledge that you haven't learned yet. You need to be ready for hours of googling around, banging your head against the wall, and feeling useless until you finally figure it out. This is true whether you know how to program or not. Not knowing how to program will make this process take much longer.
Let's do a quick example of why this is the case. A lot of online war games / tutorials focus on web application penetration testing. A beginner war game may require you to exploit an SQL injection vulnerability.
I won't describe what SQL injection is, but successfully executing an injection attack requires knowledge of the following:
If you're a programmer, you already know #1 and #2, and just need to google around and teach yourself #3. If you aren't a programmer, you'll need to verse yourself in #1 and #2 as well, likely several additional hours of learning to accomplish the same task.
If you're looking to get into ethical hacking, I'd recommend knowing the basics of the following before diving in:

Is the USAFA a good school to become an astronaut?	"Across the current corps of astronauts, the most represented schools are the U.S. Air Force Academy and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Each are represented by eight astronauts. So, sure the Air Force Academy is a good school for one to attend if one wants to be an astronaut.
But it isn?õ????t about the school. One of the really nice things about NASA is that they realize that which school you attended doesn't mean a damn. As long as the school's program is accredited, no one cares what school you went to. There are 96 schools represented in the current corps of astronauts.
It?õ????s about the first career. Being an astronaut is not a first career, it is a second career. Everyone that applies to be an astronaut has an education. Education is essentially a checkbox. What really makes candidates stand out is what they have done AFTER completing school.
That?õ????s why the U.S. Air Force Academy is a good school if one wants to be an astronaut - not because of the school, its curriculum, or its faculty - but because graduating from the Air Force Academy opens up excellent first career options in the Air Force. It is the work done while in the Air Force that catches the attention of the selection panel. The Air Force provides careers that demonstrate leadership, problem solving, teamwork, and working under stress. The Air Force provides access to building hours of high performance jet time. The Air Force provides access to working with technology.

The VC would then force the street children sell these ?õ????lighter bombs?õ???ù (booby traps) to US Service personnel for 5 cents each. Eager to score a bargain, the Americans bought them in droves. about every 20th lighter sold was a booby trap. The unwitting serviceman would try to light the unit.

Why dont Muslims acknowledge that verse 2:256 is revealed before verse 9:5 and the latter abrogates the earlier?	"There is no definite way to interpret the Quran
Some scholars a long time ago believed in a very wide definition of abrogation where Sura 9 abrogated many earlier verses. It seems to have been most popular with scholars during the crusades (years 1000?õ????1300) but I can?õ????t verify that exactly. Scholars today no longer use that wide definition of abrogation. Today scholars use a more narrow definition of abrogation where only those verses that in direct contrast are abrogated.
I?õ????ll quote from Wikipedia:
Muslim exegetes and jurists have disagreed and disputed the number of verses of the Quran and sunnah in the Hadiths recognized as abrogated. The 10th century Islamic scholar Hibatull???Åh, according to John Burton, lists 237 instances of abrogation, with the verse 9:5 ?õ???? the so-called ""Sword verse"" ?õ???? alone accounting for almost half of the abrogated verses. In contrast, the 10th century scholar Abu Ja'far an-Nahaas stated that there were only 20 cases of abrogation. az-Zarqaani concludes that only 12 cases of abrogation have occurred. The 16th century Islamic scholar Al-Suyuti argued that there are only 20 attested instances of abrogation within Quran, while the 18th century Muslim scholar Shah Wali Allah, have suggested that just five instances of abrogation exist in the Quran. The 19th century Islamic scholar Sayyid Ahmad Khan stated that ""no verse of the Quran is abrogated"" ?õ????
And regarding verse 2:256
The overwhelming majority of Muslim scholars consider that verse to be a
The majority of scholars today find it unlikely that hundreds of verses of the Quran would simply be void and useless.
When it comes to scholars, one should mention that scholars are independent and come from different schools and there is no ultimate authority, and some fundamentalists chose to reject every scholar who is not strict enough. But I?õ????ll quote from the well known Egyptian authority
The position taken by all the modern scholars whom I have met, or listened to, or whose works I have read, is contrary to the understanding of
?õ????al-Khidri?õ???ù probably refers to Shaykh Muhammad al-Khidr Husayn( 1876 - 1958 ), who was grand Imam of Al-Azhar University 1952?õ????1954.
The allegation that 120 verses on the invitation to Islam were abrogated by the verse of the sword, is in fact one of crassest stupidity and only serves to show that the great number of Muslims are in a stage of regression of either knowledge or intelligence in our time, and have become ignorant of the Qur'an. As a result of this ignorance therefore, they have forgotten how to call to the way of God, how to facilitate the call to Islam, and how to be proper examples, and how to present a good perspective. Perhaps this is the reason for the failure in the propagation of Islam, and the prolonged stagnation of the Islamic message being effected -- for it has been assumed that the sword is that which fulfills the obligation of delivering the message. Such a concept is, by the agreement of all those who are rational and discerning, totally absurd.
Here is the view of one of the currently best known living Muslim scholars,
As an example, look at what [the Sheikh of the Mufassirin Ibn Jarir al-Tabari] said about what was narrated from Qatada in the noble verse:
And what Qatada and others said - that this verse was abrogated - is a claim without any basis in the book [i.e. Qur'an], the Sunnah, and common sense, and we mentioned [many times] in this book ... that the abrogater can only abrogate in the case in which it totally negates the rule of the abrogated, and what [doesn't fulfill that condition cannot be said to be the case of an abrogation]

Why are some people more combative with non-inflammatory questions than others?	"Very minimal context here, but I'll try to be as general as possible.
Basically, when people go on unreasonably retaliative over arguments like this, there are several possibilities:
Given that it's fact versus fact, not fact versus fabricated fact that is so rampant today, people shouldn't be too offended on a discussion. But looking at current trend, things are complicated now.
Being passionate about a subject is pretty common, especially on politics, social or religious convictions.
This is a big problem nowadays. When people start to identify themselves as something, any judgment made next can be incredibly biased. ?õ????I am xxxxx?õ???ù is the common form of this phenomenon. I am a feminist, I am a Christian, I am a homosexual, I am a liberal, I am a conservative?õ????the list goes on. There's nothing wrong with having an identity, but when it gets in the way to see things rationally, re-evaluation should be high on the list of priorities.
Least complicated of the three, these are just people with very low tolerance to pain but high on ego. Luckily I've never met too many of these people, but when I do, I can't help but to feel a little bit pitiful of them for the fact that they have overestimated their competency while going around condescending people.
Hope that gives you a perspective.

Why can't aircraft fly 2-3 m above the ground?	"Why can?õ????t aircraft fly at a height of 2?õ????3m above the ground?
They can and they do.
Meet the Panavia Tornado. Operated by the British Royal Airforce, German Luftwaffe, Italian Airforce and the Royal Saudi Air Force, the Panavia Tornado is designed for ultra-low-level high-speed interdiction. Its terrain following radar allows hand free flying as close to the ground as the pilots dare.
During peacetime training operations, the aircraft are limited so they fly as a safe height over the landscape, however still low enough. I often looked down on a sight like the above picture when walking in the Scottish highlands. The aircraft hug the contours of the ground, coming up the valley. They rise just enough to get over the pass at the end of the glen, then dip down immediately just as the land dips.
During war operations, such as Operation Granby in the First Gulf War, the Tornado would be flying much lower than shown in these pictures. They really kept the craft just single digit metres off the deck when invading Iraqi airspace. They would have to rise up slightly to safely drop their bomb load, then duck back down for the run back to the Saudi border.
The reason for this extreme low flying is to avoid radar. If you keep down in among the clutter of ground objects, then the radar can?õ????t see you or track you. Visual reporting of your flight is also limited by the low level. Only people directly under your path, and with clear fields of view, will see you.
The Panavia Tornado isn?õ????t unique in this ability. Other aircraft such as the American F-111 had similar terrain following radar systems for low-level interdiction. However, the Panavia Tornado took it to the extreme.
Some other answers mention the Soviet?õ????s Caspian Sea Monster and other ekranoplans that fly in ground effect at very low altitude. The Tornado is not doing this. Ground effect only works on relatively flat and hard ground. On rough terrain, with trees, buildings, hills and ridges, the wind sheers are just as likely to slam you into the ground as lift you off it. The Soviet ekranoplans only operated at sea and in very calm conditions. In contrast, the Tornado is zipping through ravines, around valleys and over ridges, missing them by a only a whisker.
But why don?õ????t all aircraft to this?
One reason is comfort. Flying at extremely low levels means you have to adjust your altitude constantly to avoid objects such as trees and buildings as well as to follow the contours of the ground. You are going at high-speed, so even small adjustments are going to make the ride feel very bumpy. Imagine driving a monster truck cross country at several hundred miles an hour. You might be able to drive over everything in your path, but your posterior is going to remember the ride for a long time.
Another reason is safety. If something goes wrong, you have little time to react. You are so near the ground that any error means hitting the ground. You don?õ????t want your posterior rubbing the grass.
Also, near the ground, turbulence is more common. You might have noticed when flying commercially, that you feel more turbulence during the initial climb and final descent stages of the flight. This is going to add to the comfort and safety issue already mentioned.
The above is not the best quality video, camcorders of 1991 weren?õ????t the same as a GoPro today, but it shows the Tornado in action during the Gulf War. Points to note at about 1 minute in, the Tornado buzzes an aircraft carrier and some other ships. The carrier flight deck is clearly above the height of the Tornado on the first pass and the Tornado is well below the mast of the other ships. At about 4 minutes 40 seconds into the video, there is a scene with two Tornadoes in close formation skimming low level over the desert dunes. The shadow of the lead plane indicates that at times it is only a few metres off the crest of the dune.

What does isotropic materials mean?	"Isotropic Material is defined as if its mechanical and thermal properties are the same in all directions. Isotropic materials can have a homogeneous or non-homogeneous microscopic structures. For example, steel demonstrates isotropic behavior, although its microscopic structure is non-homogeneous.
If the response of the material is independent of the orientation of the load axis of the sample, then we say that the material is isotropic or in other words we can say that isotropy of a material in a characteristics, which gives us the information that the properties are the same in the three orthogonal directions x y z, on the other hand if the response is dependent on orientation it is known as anisotropic.

How does the rest of the world see Pakistan?	"As a potential investor, I do have to mention some serious problems in Pakistan with honesty.
I am a Chinese. My motherland is the steel-brother of Pakistan. Therefore, I hope that the Pakistanis can catch up with China?õ????s step.
I have witnessed some Westerners making complaints about the poor infrasturacture and the high levels of non-educated people. But in the long run, I have to say
When we travel back towards the 1970s, all of those complaints ring true inside China. Everything was hungry. And my honorable father once mentioned how this country was commonly thought as the hopeless land by the Westerners. He once was laughed at by an American. In that moment, he swore inside his deep heart that he would construct his own motherland alone with his bare hands.
Through nearly 40 years of hard efforts, he gradually rose from a poorly skilled worker to a successful bussinessman. However, he visited Gwadar two years ago and heard similar complaints from his partners. He just smiled and said:
And not much later, he sighed a treaty with the local government. As of 2017, construction is ongoing, but we still have some serious problems:
I once sympathized about the plight of an extremely poor local larborer and introduced a well paid part-time job to better his life. To my surprise, he refused and just did nothing during his spare time.
The ordinary Pakistanis should know that hard work can change their daily lives. They shouldn't be content or as satisfied with their current situation. Don't just admire the life of developed country, but believe you can become rich and better your lives. Your own hands are the key to success.
2. The locals are not used to tolerating foreign cultures. (This is a true story from me).
One of my fellow workers didn't know about the culture of Pakistan and got drunk in front of a local laborer in the restaurant. But then, the local laborer claimed to be killing my fellow for his offence against Allah. I was extremely shocked by this accident. Why can an ordinary person be so radicalized?
The religion should discipline yourself not others, which is the good attitude.
3. The extremely low social status of woman.
I seldom see female workers. And even when I know more, I am really shocked that these women are generally treated as reproduction tools.
I really want to ask
Can't the women produce?
Can't women do work as the men do?
Once Pakistan release the women, they will provide a greatly-needed boost to the workforce across their country.
4. The plight of the massive number of child labours.
When I was young, my family was also very poor like many ordinary families inside China. But no matter what my parents were suffering from, they had always offered the best conditions as possible.
My grandmother always said how their own generation had no chance to get a good education. But we still couldn't let our next generations suffer from the same tragedy.
I hope that Pakistanis realize it and will place a great importance for any of their future children's education, despite what they may be suffering.

What did you hate about National Service in Singapore?	"Beyond our training period, we being to question many of the rules. Why do we need to march to cookhouse and sing stupid songs? Why do we need to do guard duty? Since there is nothing to do for the rest of the day/week, why do still we need to stay in? We have numerous weeks when we do nothing for the whole week. However, we need to follow the system for ?õ????regimental purposes?õ???ù.
In NS there is this reverse meritocracy in place - the worse you do, the better your life. So the ideal career path in NS is to malinger after being completing BMT. So my platoon we had 6 out of 23 who went out of course - for back pain, knee pain or ankle pain. They will also be assigned office or storeman jobs. And for the rest of their NS life, they will not have guard duty, and they can choose not to march.
We really hate those people manage to make it to HQ. They are an eyesore. It is difficult to motivate us from here: Why should I care to train if people can just OOC become storeman lepak all day?
If Kim Jung Nam dies at our airport instead, I am not confident how much my platoon, if they are on standby that week, will fare. I might be the one dying too.
(Moreover, I do not know whether is our unit involved, or the Hazmat unit in SCDF. I do not know why there are two units doing the same thing.)
Fortunately for Singapore, shit didn?õ????t happen. But if Mr. Kim got attacked in our airport, I can justify to my peers that I could have been one of the responders who did a great job. I can?õ????t.
There isn?õ????t much that we could train for, given our resources. Really, we only have that much equipment and that much consumables. Other than following instructions, I have no idea of the actual process when shit actually happen. To see how our work fit into the bigger picture, we need to participate in an full-scale exercise with other units.
So we are in this ironic situation of not being unprepared, and not being able to prepare more, and unprepared. After the first year, we are simply waiting for ORD, wasting our time, not feeling growth.
Once again, I really do not mind spending two years of my life for the frankly amazing but delicate nation. But I do mind wasting

"As a gay person, could you be friends with a highly religious person who thinks homosexuality is wrong?"	"Funnily enough, I did have a friend who was very religious.
I go to a catholic school, so obviously a lot of my friends are very devout catholics. I do not speak to them about my sexuality and they don?õ????t ask because I know what they think of me. I?õ????d rather uneasy friends than none at all.
However, one friend that I met online, was a fair bit older than me and had a little boy around fourteen months old. We got into an argument about LGBT education in schools, and she told me she would be teaching her son that being gay is wrong and sinful regardless of what the school tells him.
I was a little shocked by that. This woman and I had been close friends for a year. So I asked her, ?õ????Do you think I?õ????m a bad person for being gay??õ???ù
The response I got was yes. I asked ?õ????Why have you acted so nicely to me when you think that??õ???ù
?õ????Because when we first met I didn?õ????t know, and now I didn?õ????t know how to tell you without hurting your feelings. I love the sinner, hate the sin.?õ???ù
Love the sinner, hate the sin. That hurts. My sexuality is a big part of who I am, it defines who I love, and love is important to me. So she hates a part of me thats so huge, but loves me as a person? Bullshit.
I think whether two groups of people like that can be friends very much depends on how vocal someones dislike for gay people are. I could not be friends with someone like that again, who hates homosexuality, because it actually, seriously hurt.
If they aren?õ????t very vocal about it, if they just feel a little uneasy because they don?õ????t know how to feel, I?õ????m fine with that. Make your own decision. But once you start preaching hate against me, thats it. I can?õ????t be friends with you anymore.

The South African rand (ZAR) continues to weaken after apartheid. What are the implications on the state of the country pre- and post-apartheid?	"Thanks for the A2A
During apartheid: the ZAR became almost untradeable and there was little or no investment in the country. It is my opinion that this was the simple truth that forced the government of the day to the negotiation table: they could no longer pay for their ideology.
Post apartheid: fact of life - nothing, NOTHING is for free - somebody always has to pay. At some point you need to confront economic reality and your suit must be cut to suit your cloth. At some point the children (read citizens) need to be told that there ain?õ????t no money to do everything we want to do ideologically until and unless we can all find jobs. Is this right, is it even remotely fair - hell no, but that is the reality.
in other words: some pragmatism and honesty from all our politicians would be helpful.
To answer your question: the ZAR will continue to weaken as long as our politicians keep making unrealistic promises, playing the blame game and kick the can down the road. The result could very easily be catastrophic but I hope not.

"Should I accept my CSU offer or attend a CC, then a UC to ultimately apply for dental school?"	"If your career plan is to go to dental school, I would go to SJSU. Most community colleges won?õ????t have the classes you need to meet dental school requirements. And there are a lot of requirements.
Trying to complete all of your general requirements at a community college with the intention of cramming all other dental school requirements in 2 years at a UC is not a good idea. Your GPA may suffer at the UC because you have to take many difficult classes in the same quarter/semester. You might not be able to do pre-dental clubs or activities important to dental school applications too. The application process to UCs will take up a lot of your time at community college.
Lastly, if you would be happier at SJSU than going through another laborious application process, stay at SJSU. You can be successful at any school as long as you work hard and take advantage of the resources available to you.

Why do criminals have to kill elephants to get the ivory? Can't they just cut the teeth?	"Imagine someone walks to you and politely says ?õ????sir, I need your tooth. All I need is for you to sit right here and I will take care of the rest. I have brand new tools as you can see and I can anesthetize you if you?õ????d like. It will be quick and painless.?õ???ù
How does that sound? How about this version. An alien walks to you with a giant needle and a set of tools and says ?õ????minibiru mastm wipp caburd whoppskt cantemfls knwoggj wimdpstk.?õ???ù Chances are you will run away (never mind the alien experience is scary on its own). But the alien chases you, pins you down, grabs you by the head and goes for your teeth.
The simple answer to your question is that the criminals kill the elephant because they don't care about the elephant, all they care about is the tusk(s), every bit of it. I won't post a graphic image of a dead elephant with its tusks removed, but I will post this
Maybe it will help visualize how up and deep into the skull you have to go in order to get the whole tusk. That's a lot of flesh you have to cut through. But it doesn't end there. Because poachers track their animals (elephants or rhinos), sometimes for days, it is a waste of time for the hunter to track an animal which tusks have already been removed. A dead animal ensures that the poachers don't waste time the next time they are following tracks. Sick.
It is an awful practice fueled by pure superstition.

What childhood memory/experience still haunts you? How do you deal with it?	"My grandpa died when I was 10.
We went to the funeral and it was an open casket. The casket was set away from the main gathering area (so you didn?õ????t have to view if you didn?õ????t want to).
I was terrified of the thought that my grandpa?õ????s dead body was over there. My mom assured me that I didn?õ????t have to go over there, and she went off to talk with one of her sisters.
That?õ????s when my grandma found me.
She asked if I?õ????d ?õ????said goodbye to grandpa?õ???ù and motioned towards the viewing area.
My eyes widened and I shook my head. No way. Last time I saw him he was about 70 pounds (he had had cancer and lost a ton of weight) and it had already frightened me to see him so frail.
My grandma had other plans.
She grabbed my arm and said ?õ????Well you
I frantically searched for my mom, but she was busy talking to a group of people.
At 10, I was old enough that I knew not to cause a scene- especially at such a somber occasion. I was too afraid to say ?õ????I don?õ????t want to?õ???ù because that sounded like I didn?õ????t want to say goodbye. I was only ten, and my young brain couldn?õ????t think of anything quick enough to get out of it.
She pulled me (terrified) all the way across the large room while chatting about what a great turnout it was, and we stepped down into the section with the casket and flowers.
I decided I would just keep my head down, say ?õ????Goodbye grandpa?õ???ù and walk away without looking.
But I didn?õ????t.
Stupid 10-year-old me glanced up as I said it and I saw him.
His face was an odd type of pale- not a color I recognized. His cheeks were hollowed in. His neck was too skinny. He didn?õ????t look like my grandpa?õ???? well, he did but he didn?õ????t.
It was terrible. I said my goodbye and she released my arm. I ran back to my mom and glued myself to her for the rest of the day.
Even now, when I think of my grandpa, that?õ????s the first image that pops into my brain before I shove it aside for the happier memories. I doubt it will ever go away. It?õ????s etched in a way that only a troubling childhood experience can be etched.
I dealt with it later in life by thinking about it from my grandma?õ????s point of view.
I assume she didn?õ????t see the fear written all over my face.

Why must I use vapor instead of smoking?	"Its not a must for you to do anything, last I checked no laws force you to vape.
But as for the advantages of vapor over smokes.
Just ask yourself, have you heard of any smoker who suffered serious health issues due to nicotine? nicotine overdose? No? didn?õ????t think so.
Because nicotine is the only ingredient vapor has in common with cigarettes.
I?õ????ve not heard of vapers having health problems due to nicotine either.
But what you have surely heard of, is lung cancer, heart disease and probably a lot which I can remember off the top of my head being caused by chemicals in cigarettes.
Well those are not present in vapors. Aside from nicotine, all other ingredients can be found in a bakery shop.
That is not to say vaping is 100% healthy but the common consensus is that it is a hell lot healthier.
Not to mention, I have switched to vaping for 3 weeks now.
My stamina has increase at by leaps and bounds.

"I sold my car in Iowa this week, how long should I wait before I cancel the insurance?"	"The insurance may be canceled when you relinquish physical possession of the vehicle, after sale of the car and after title transfer.
Someone buys the car and you give them the title to it. It is the only car you have. Buyer asks you to keep the car for them until they come to pick it up at some future time. Meanwhile, you have their permission to drive it. You don?õ????t know if the new owner has yet insured the car. Maybe they will wait until they finally pick it up to handle licensing, registration, etc.
If you cancel your policy, and then the car is involved in an accident (even while just sitting in your driveway) you are out of luck - no coverage. What kind of accident while just sitting in your driveway? The kind where some children play ?õ????car,?õ???ù release the brakes, and run over a playmate behind the vehicle.
Therefore, the time to cancel the coverage is:
When you actually cancel the coverage, the insurance company will give you some latitude on the effective date of cancellation. You could give them the date on which the car was sold at that point, if it is not too far into the past.
But what if you have another car of your own, so you still have a policy? If you had immediately canceled coverage on the vehicle sold, and some uninsured accident occurred, you would have coverage under your policy. But the removal of the vehicle might well arouse some dispute by your insurance company, depending on how well they understand their own policy (many agents, adjustors and company people, sadly, are clueless). Technically, the car would need to be added back to the policy and then deleted again at a later date. So, why fuss? Wait as described above, and avoid any issues.
Bottom line: be sure you are
Hope that helps.

How do you distance yourself from someone who wants to be closer friends without being rude?	"You know what, I think you already know the answer to the question. If you are interested in them, then just show that you?õ????re not interested. If they ask you out, just find excuses to decline their offer and learn to say no. Try to spend less time with them and be less responsive to their text or conversation. Being polite doesn't necessarily mean you have to say yes all the time. There is nothing wrong with maintaining distance, because friendship should not feel like a burden or toil.

"Are you still an atheist if you reject God even if proof of his existence was discovered, or is there a different term for this?"	"Are you still an atheist if you reject God even if proof of his existence was discovered, or is there a different term for this?
Speaking for myself. I do not reject God (or gods). What I do reject, is your god story, whether it is Lord Krishna, Allah, Yahweh and Jesus, Yahweh without Jesus, Akal Purakh, Ahura Mazda, or any of the other fictional god characters in the multitude of allegedly divinely revealed religious texts.
If we would suddenly receive verifiable evidence that a god(s) exist, then I (and I reckon most atheists) would become deists like Thomas Paine, founding father of the US. He was a deist who believed in God, but he described organised religions, such as Christianity and Islam, as ?õ????
If we would get proof that a specific god exists, say the one in the Bible, then I think many of us will become
On the other hand, Akal Purakh, the Sikh god, has allegedly divinely revealed to his prophet, the Guru Nanak, in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib that all people, regardless of their gender, ethnicity or religious beliefs are equal before him. As a result, Sikhs are some of the most egalitarian, peaceful and altruistic people that I know. Akal Purakh seems like a nice creator dude. I could live with that.

Shouldn't handguns be prohibited because they are useless to a militia?	"Useless to a militia? That will come as quite a shock to?õ????literally every modern military in the world.
Really? That will come as quite a shock to?õ????literally every police officer in the United States.
I don?õ????t know what kind of handguns you?õ????ve been playing with (or maybe I should say, what egregiously inaccurate action movies you?õ????ve been watching) but this idea that handguns are completely useless beyond a short distance is absurd. If handguns really were that shitty
Evidently you?õ????ve never heard of
Indeed, the use of handguns to protect against animal attacks goes back over a hundred years. Hunters in India during the British Raj commonly carried large-caliber pistols in addition to their rifles. The rifle was for taking down whatever animal the hunter was tracking, but the pistol was there in case some crafty animal snuck up and attacked the hunter. If a tiger or a wolf jumps on you it?õ????s a lot easier to defend yourself with a small but hefty hand cannon than with a long rifle or shotgun.
Oh, cool. Can I have a short-barreled rifle or a sawed-off shotgun that?õ????s easier to store and easier to maneuver indoors? No? Oh right, you guys took those away from us with the National Firearms Act when you arbitrarily decided those were useless for self-defense and only good for committing crimes.
So what happens when another anti-gun person like yourself comes along and decides that my standard-size rifle or shotgun should be prohibited because it?õ????s too unwieldy for home defense and only useful for making war on the US government?

How tall are you? Do you like being that height?	"I'm 5'8"" / 173cm. It's OK.
I've been this tall since I was 10 years old - for all of middle school I was always the big kid. Then everyone else had a growth spurt and I... didn't. So here I am.
I never really thought about it too much in high school, I ran track (where height is an advantage but being skinny is almost as good) and skied (where height really doesn't matter) so it didn't seem to make too much difference.
College was a different story. I don't know if it was a function of being at UC Berkeley, which had a fairly dysfunctional dating scene, or just being around a bunch of really insecure women, but all of the sudden height became the single most important characteristic for all of the women I met, many of whom had somewhat absurd requirements (eg. I'm 5'1"" but won't date a man shorter than 6'2""). That was really miserable.
After college however, things were totally different. Yes, there were still women who preferred taller guys, but there were also plenty of women who didn't think it was a big deal (I even dated a woman who was 6'1"" for about six months), and dating wasn't a problem.
Now that I'm married (my wife is 5'7"") I obviously don't care about this aspect of it.
In business I think the impact of height is underplayed but very real:
on average CEOs were just a shade under six feet. Given that the average American male is 5?õ????9?õ???? that means that CEOs, as a group, have about three inches on the rest of their sex. But this statistic actually understates matters. In the U.S. population, about 14.5 percent of all men are six feet or over. Among CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, that number is 58 percent. Even more strikingly, in the general American population, 3.9 percent of adult men are 6?õ????2?õ???? or taller. Among my CEO sample, 30 percent were 6?õ????2?õ???? or taller.
Say what you will of Malcolm Gladwell (who incidentally happens to be pretty tall), but it's an interesting statistic nevertheless. It's not an overt bias, and I've certainly done pretty well so far in my career, but particularly in large companies, when you reach the executive level people talk about things like ""having a presence"" and ""being able to command a room"" which are often unconscious shorthand for being tall. So it's certainly not impossible to succeed in business being of average or shorter height, but it's an additional hurdle to overcome.
There are some additional pros and cons that I've experienced that I'll bullet out here:
So all in all, it's fine. Once you're comfortable with who you are life gets easier, so being shorter or of average height might mean dealing with some extra crap that you wouldn't necessarily be stuck with if you were taller, but it's probably not the difference between a good and bad life unless you allow it to be.

I have $800 to invest. What should I do to make money?	"I started with 300$ and now after three months I have a steady revenue of 150 dollars per month, in Bitcoin. The answer you are looking for is to join a cloud mining company.
How does it supposedly work? You invest in the company who owns datacenters and mines Bitcoin, your investment is steadily returned to you as the company creates new blocks of Bitcoin.
You will make your initial investments back in approx. 2~ months after which it starts to being profitable. ~45% profit monthly, yeah its that insane. On average I get only 5 bucks a day but in the end its free money.
You can get started with 6.20$ worth of bitcoins which will get you 20 kilohash/s, and you'll receive 15 kilohash/s free (bonus bitcoins) upon signing up.
So what you have to do? Register with only your email, buy some hashing power with bitcoins, insert your bitcoin wallet code and start receiving daily payments. It's that simple, the only string attached is that you cannot be sure for how long the company is running for, thats where the gamble is at, but so far 2 years up and running and successfully paying out profits.
Do your research and make your own decisions but I'm just here to let you know of this possibility.

What are some awesome conversation starters for an extrovert in training?	"I am an ambivert, so i kind of get this question with both points of view.
One thing that i have always done when i'm trying to start up a conversation with someone is compliment them! But, don't just make something up, actually compliment them on, say, their earrings or cool t-shirt. After the compliment, ask them where they got it, talk about how you were looking for a pair like that, or maybe you found a pair of earrings at a thrift store like them, or just anything about it in general (this is a hypothetical conversation, obviously. Just try to branch off of the compliment and talk about yourself and your stuff, get what i mean?) Most of the time, they will compliment you back. If they don't, than that's fine, too. They may an introvert and not in the mood/too shy to talk.
Another good conversation starter is to talk about the surrounding situation, which, like i said before with the compliment, is likely to drift off into something completely different. So, if you're at a party, you could talk about how the party is going well or that the person who organized it did a good job. Also, you can start a conversation with something random. Sometimes, ill just ask, ?õ????hey, great party, right? So i was chatting with someone about -insert tv show title- ending, did you like it? Because i didn't!?õ???ù or something along those lines. I know it can be frightening at first to walk up to an acquaintance/stranger and just start talking, but don't be scared. The only way you're going to make friends and get better at conversations is putting yourself out there.
So, the most important piece of advice i will give you is to never choke up. Try your best to keep the conversation going, even if they don't respond the first time around. Talk about the shirt you found last saturday at forever 21, or how you just got into art school and you're really excited. Keep the chat going, and don't be nervous. They're just a person, like you.
I wish you the best in becoming an extrovert, but always remember, don't be ashamed if you're an introvert. Both are great in their own ways. Good luck!

If you would undo one thing in time what would that thing be?	"Time as I understand it, which I hope is correct, is very temperamental and compensating.
For instance:
Person 1: I'm going to go back in time and stop me from Asking out Jane Doe
*Person 1 does thing
Time: Ah Persons never asked out Jane Doe? Well the timeline where he did stops existing.
Now if I am wrong, someone please correct me but I'm sure time has to correct itself because it has already happened.
Looking at Time from a 4D perspective, you'd see all of a timeline happening simultaneously. Now, since all of this timeline is already planned and happened Cha going something would set every event after that haywire. But Time adjusts for changes by erasing the old changed timeline and replacing it with the new edited one. Sort of like how one would delete one sentence I'm favor of another because it sounds better in a paragraph. The previous sentence and new sentence can't exist in the same space simultaneously because it would be a jumbled and tangled mess. Same with time, both timelines cannot simultaneously exist because it would be jumbled up and chock full of paradoxes.

Can you post your speculations about Fantastic Beasts second movie?	"Yes, I agree with @
As for my speculation. I feel it was Dumbledore's grand scheme to send Newt to America to stop Grindelwald. Grindelwald knew what an Obscurus can do, the power they possess and their emotional disposition( that they can be influenced easily) through Dumbeldore's sister Ariana who I'm assuming was an obscurus, according to her description in the 7th book. Why I think that, is because, when Newt catches and disarms Graves ( Grindelwald) there was no reason for him to use the Revelio charm. I'm guessing he knew all along that there was something fishy going on. And sailing all the way form England just to free Frank seems odd.
P.S. I know it seems farfetched but if it turns out to be true, you know where you read it first. ;)

How do I overcome doubt?	"We all struggle with doubt, however, if doubt is constantly at your door, you may struggle with confidence issues as well.
Overcoming doubt is a change in the way we think. A mindset change.
These are some steps that might help you:
Take an inventory of the negative feelings you have about yourself or things you want to change. Choose only one to work on.
Keep track of these thoughts. Notice when they come up. Do these thoughts come up at work, with family, in your relationships with friends or with your partner? How many times do you notice the thought or habit you want to change?
Know that the negative tapes that run through your head are imprinted. It?õ????s hard to undo, unless you intentionally practice it over and over again. Think of what to replace that negative thinking with. If you are a worrier, ask yourself what worrying is helping you solve. If you are constantly comparing, start to intentionally focus on your accomplishments and successes instead of what others are doing.
Replace the old tapes in your head with positive affirmations. This has worked for me when I have had to speak to a group of people. I tell myself that I am confident, prepared and that the audience will embrace what I say. I repeat this several times before I speak. It calms those old tapes of: ?õ????You?õ????re not good enough?õ???ù, ?õ????No one will listen?õ???ù, ?õ????You have no idea what you are talking about?õ???ù.
Know that however long you have lived, you have continually practiced your unhealthy or negative way of thinking. It may take months or even years to re-train your brain. Over time it will become easier. Don?õ????t expect immediate success and don?õ????t give up even if you mess up several times. You have to keep trying.
Look at your brain as a muscle. How many times a week do body builders have to lift and workout to get the body they desire? How many times does it take for someone to practice on the piano to become an expert pianist?
This is achievable if you truly want it. Some give up too easily because they want a quick fix. Know that everything in life takes hard work and perseverance. There is no quick fix.
Know that change is painful, disruptive, messy and hard. If you look back at the peaks of growth periods in your life, you will realize the months or years of chaos and confusion that came before your awareness of the growth that happened within.
Your desire to change must be greater than your desire to stay the same

Relax! Let go of it. Trundle off in a random direction; do something else like washing the dishes or if You feel exhausted have a nap or even sleep over it.
Don?õ????t allow being caught by the very bit that got You stuck, stay random. It?õ????s not important, leave it aside. Pick the (Your) easy way.

The point is to undo the knot and in the process of doing this several times over You learn Your best way of learning on the side. That?õ????s worth gold and platinum!

How do I gain more subcribers and views in Youtube?	"If you?õ????re looking to increase your YouTube views, take a look at the following 3 simple ways of getting more views on YouTube.
In terms of easy YouTube views, annotations are by far some of the most effective methods of getting more people to watch your videos. If you?õ????re wondering what YouTube annotations are, they?õ????re basically those text boxes which appear during videos, with messages such as ?õ????Subscribe?õ???ù or ?õ????Like our page?õ???ù, or ?õ????click for part 2?õ???ù etc.
The reason why they?õ????re so effective is that they allow you to easily link from one video to the next, as well as to playlists, your channel, and much more. If you have more content, YouTube annotations are fantastic ways of directing viewers to your other content, which in turn will help to increase views across your entire channel, and hopefully increase your number of subscribers in the process.
One of the most effective things you can do to increase your views is to gain more subscribers. Subscribers are your entire fan base, and they?õ????ve subscribed to you for a reason, usually because they like what you post. As they?õ????re fans of yours, this means they want to see what you post, so as soon as you post something, the majority of your subscribers will watch it right away, without you needing to do anything more.
Naturally then, the more subscribers you have, the more potential YouTube views you will have as a result. To gain more subscribers, make sure your content is worthwhile, use annotations encouraging users to ?õ????click here to subscribe?õ???ù and better still, if you?õ????re blogging or speaking directly in your videos, ask your viewers to spare a second or two and to subscribe to your channel or to share your channel with their friends.
Social proof, also known as the ?õ????monkey see, monkey do effect?õ???ù, can be a powerful tool to grow your YouTube channel and attract more views than YouTube can count. The simple effect of having a popular video and channel can pull people into watching your videos, subscribing to your channel, sharing your video with their friends or even embedding your video on their blog ?õ???? all because you?õ????re already popular and have a solid reputation.
While this is usually the reward users get after months or years of hard work ?õ???? there is a shortcut. Simply put, you can hire a professional and quality marketing company like
Well, I had great experiences with this, that?õ????s why I recommend it to you right away. But that?õ????s totally OK if you just give it a look. I believe that it will attract you by the first time you see it.
Using these 3 techniques can substantially grow your YouTube channel and help you get more YouTube views than you could have even imagined. Using these growth hacks have enabled some of the most successful YouTubers to explode their growth and realize their potential ?õ???? you?õ????d be wise to do the same!

"What does it mean when a Freemason says ""you have the light""?"	"Along with the other respondents, I have never (in 40 years of being a Freemason and being in most side degrees and having achieved the 33rd degree) heard that specific phrase in English Freemasonry.
However, in accord with the general idea that ?õ????Light = Knowledge = Wisdom?õ???? there is an allusion to Light in the third degree when the candidate is told that ?õ?????õ????the light of a Master Mason is darkness visible?õ?????õ???? meaning being able to see
Before Anderson?õ????s constitutions deChristianised Freemasonry in 1720s England to render it ?õ????Deist?õ???? (basically, one main God, call him what you like), it had a more Christian allusion and the same tract to which I referred above still ends with the phrase ?õ????to lift our eyes to that bright morning star, whose rising brings peace and salvation to the faithful and obedient of the human race?õ????. The Christians will see this as a reference to Christ?õ????s ascension but non Christians can apply other interpretations. I know that Hindu freemasons in India use one of the Christian Masonic Side Degrees (the 18th degree of the Ancient and Accepted Rite) which is blatantly Christian but they just refer to Christ as ?õ????The Great Exemplar?õ???? rather than ?õ????The Redeemer?õ???? or ?õ????The Saviour?õ????. (Most non Christian religions acknowledge Christ as being a prophet, a good chap who said some very wise things!)
There are probably hundreds of allusions to ?õ????Light?õ???? in Masonic ceremonies and they always refer to ?õ????Knowledge?õ???? or ?õ????Wisdom?õ????.
The great period of learning and discovery in the 17th & 18th centuries is commonly called ?õ????The Age of En

How do I convert 10 point CGPA to percentage?	"CGPA is defined on all student's comparative performance. suppose in 100 mark paper highest mark secured by topper is 90 marks then. 90 marks will be 100% and if student x will get 80 marks then CGPA of student x will be: 100/90*80 = 88.89 . on scale of 10 its 8.9.
The Board took the result of the last five years and calculated the average marks of all candidates who had scored between 91 and 100. That average turned out to be close to 95 marks. Since the equivalent Grade Point for the 91-100 band (A1 grade) of marks is 10, it then divided the average result of 95 by 10. The result is 9.5.
Please not that it differs from university to university.

How can we be sure that God does not exist and that we have completed our research?	"*sigh*
The problem with these questions is that they never specify what is actually meant by ?õ????God.?õ???ù Are we talking about the God described in any particular religion?õ????s holy books and actually worshiped by anybody? Are we talking about a God who has been described as having any particular traits or characteristics that could actually be tested against? Or are we defining ?õ????God?õ???ù a some some sort of amorphous ?õ????beyond time and space?õ???ù, ?õ????pure mind?õ???ù, ?õ????created the universe and never interacts with the universe since the creation?õ???ù sort of being that is incapable of being examined in any way?
For the sake of argument, however, let?õ????s assume that the person asking the question isn?õ????t just playing games and is referring to the specific God he or she believes in and worships. And, since we don?õ????t actually know which God that is, let?õ????s further assume that it?õ????s the standard Christian God as described in the Bible and not some abstract concept of ?õ????God is Nature?õ???ù or ?õ????God is Love?õ???ù or the such. How can we be sure that this God does not exist?
Well, there?õ????s a lot to be said for the fact that there is a complete lack of credible evidence to support the existence of such a God for one thing. Lack of evidence, by itself, doesn?õ????t necessarily
There?õ????s also a lot to be said for the logical contradictions inherent in the standard Christian God concept. I?õ????m not just talking about the Trinity (three separate beings who are simultaneously separate yet one), but also about the notion that God is both transcendent (existing entirely outside of time and space) and immanent (wholly existing within the universe). Transcendence and Immanence are opposites, and you cannot logically be both ?õ????A?õ???ù and ?õ????Not A?õ???ù (see the
Aside from those, however, consider the following (and again, I am just talking about the standard Christian concept of God here):
Right there we have enough to be sure that ?õ????God?õ???ù (at least the standard Christian God) can?õ????t possibly exist. Sure, we could make it work if we didn?õ????t worry about Him being Omniscient, Omnipotent

How is MMU Mullana for B. tech?	"Maharishi Markandeshwar University AKA MMU Mullana is a good college known for it?õ????s faculty, infrastructure and placement in middle range of price. It is a self claimed university for providing American level education in Indian price, where out of all colleges established under MMU it?õ????s Engineering domain itself have more than 400 faculties to teach various subject to students.
All the faculties are highly qualified having at least masters and 70?õ????80% of them are even having PhDs or pursuing. This facilities are also having good years of work experience where some of them having 400?õ????500 months of work experience, So it might be good to consider that MMU is having wide range of qualified and experienced facilities. On the year of 2015 some students who came here for higher studies are from NITs, BITS, or from top colleges
There are 88 companies or businesses started by it?õ????s Alumni from a range of 5 year (2011?õ????2015)
Infosys, TCS and Vodafone are major brands who came for placement drives in MMU Mullana, also IBM, Capgemini, Indian Army, Mahindra Tech., Tata Motors can found here hiring some of the best students. Maximum number of companies who come here for hiring are Startups who claim to give a good package of 4?õ????7l/a Rs., where average salaries or packages provides to 2016 batch was 2,40,000 Rs per annum. This is also a good range of package and 80?õ????100 companies/startups visits MMU for hiring every year is also a good number, according to me it is also good for placement. If a person is good in his/her own domain and particular to his/her subject would sure get placement from campus itself.
This varsity is known for it?õ????s infrastructure, so it may not leave you in any condition where you can?õ????t find yourself to self improved. According to me this is the only varsity in a range of money who provides such type of Infrastructure, faculty and facilities, it is widening and developing itself to be on the top, so it might be good decision of you to get in.

Which excuse is the best in terms of blowing off a girl that I had plans to sleep with tomorrow?	"I would shower with her and then give her a ?õ???? blow dry?õ???ù today and then would also would ?õ???? blow ?õ???? her off tomorrow. I am an 87 year old and your question is either stupid or immature. You do not have a sense of humor. In California they passed a law in 1972 stating whatever two consenting adults do in private is legal. When you are ?õ???? blowing off?õ???ù your potential girl friend timing is also very crucial. An old experienced professional like myself has years of experience in the category of human interaction. I do have an extraneous variable that provides limitations on my intimate behavior due to natural causes related to aging. I would recommend the ?õ???? blowing off?õ???ù approach because the Catholic Church in the third century stated that it was a sin for a woman to be on top curing copulation. They wanted men to dominate women. You do not want her to commit a ?õ???? sin?õ???ù so ?õ???? blowing off?õ???ù may be your best recourse. However, according to the Roman Catholic Church this is also a sin because it is not related to procreation. So, you wish to save her soul from sinning from either non-natural issues or fornication because you are not married. Also, if you decide to ?õ???? play with your self?õ???ù that is also a mortal sin and you will go to hell. However, even thinking about sexual behavior is also a sin. The Pope once stated in the Seventies that when a man looks at his wife with LUST it is a sin. You now have all kinds of arguments to provide. However, I can get you out of this problem of ?õ???? sinning?õ???ù and causing your girlfriend and yourself committing a mortal sin and going to HELL. Solution!!

"If Hitler did not kill himself, would he have been murdered, put on trial, or something else?"	"Hitler was the enemy and threat to humanity, so killing him would have been self-defense, not murder.
Stalin wouldn't have gained much from torturing Hitler. Sure, he was hated, but it wouldn't be useful to Stalin. Instead, Stalin would have likely had his best doctors tend to Hitler to ensure he was healthy. Then, he would likely have a private meeting where he could revel in his victory and his rival?õ????s defeat and shame. Afterward, Hitler would have been paraded around Moscow and face a public trial. He would have been found guilty of genocide, starting war, etc. and sentenced to death. It may very well have been a public execution, with Hitler surrounded by his enemies, facing down Soviet rifles.
It's quite probable Stalin would've had Hitler preserved and displayed in a Soviet museum.
Same as above, but it'd be US Military brass doing the revelling, the public execution would be private, and Hitler would likely be buried in an unmarked grave, not placed in a museum.

"Who would win, Sceptile, Blaziken, or Swampert?"	"Well, it depends on how they're trained. Given the way the Pokemon are normally trained, my money would be on Blaziken.
Sceptile is clearly the fastest, and easily one shots Swampert. The only way Swampert could survive a hit is if he has a focus band. Then Blaziken would take out Sceptile and would be the winner.
But there's another option. Let's say this was a fight that these Pokemon were breed and trained for. Sceptile will basically always be the fastest, so if we give him a life orb, an attack boosting nature, Max his attack EVs, and then give him earthquake, he can take Blaziken out.
Swampert can then take out Sceptile if his special attack EVs are maxed and has a good nature for it. Unfortunately blizzard only has 75 percent accuracy, so Sceptile might live. Ice beam has better accuracy but can't one shot Sceptile. If blizzard misses, Sceptile will lay waste the next turn with just about any grass type move.
So if I were in this situation, I would want to have Sceptile. His chances of surviving are the best, and he's the best one to take out the other two.
Note, this doesn't take mega evolutions into account, maybe I'll add that later on.

"You must prepare an amazing dish for Gordon Ramsay with ingredients in your fridge and cupboards right now. On a scale of 1-10, how screwed are you?"	"I think I would be pretty good!

Plus I look like I?õ????m 12?õ????13, so he wouldn?õ????t curse at little me!)
Not trying to make this into a Treager Challenge, but you never said how long I had to cook, only that I had to prepare it right now. And, technically, my freezer(s) are attached to my fridge(s). So, I?õ????d start with a bread basket, with homemade Parker House rolls:
Then, I?õ????d make an appetizer. Let?õ????s see?õ????
Mmhmm?õ????okay, now that I?õ????ve read up on Gordon Ramsay, I think I?õ????ll serve him homemade fettuccine alfredo (possibly with chicken). The best part? I?õ????ll make my own pasta noodles!
Mmmm?õ????homemade and sure to warm Chef?õ????s heart!
Now we get on to my favorite part: DESSERT! See, I?õ????m more of a baker (which is not to say that I can?õ????t cook up a meal delicious enough to win over Chef completely), so this would be the point in time where I loosened up and enjoyed making this 100%!
I?õ????m a bit torn, though. I have made my own dessert recipe (sorry, it?õ????s a secret!), but I don?õ????t really know if it would pair well with the hearty and filling chicken fettuccine alfredo (the recipe calls for a LOT of butter.) So, I?õ????d probably go with what I love after fettuccine:
Olive Garden Lemon Cake!!!
Now, yes, I don?õ????t have cream cheese, but I have whipping cream, sour cream, I believe some yogurt, plenty of butter?õ????I could whip up something that would be as good if not better!
Now, to drink?õ????well, there?õ????s no wine to be found, but there is?õ????
(And yes, I made the recipe card. Hey, I got bored and thought it needed jazzing up!)
Though actually, you could just drink the ?õ????syrup?õ???? and it would be fine (it?õ????s not too sweet, which is what I like about it!)
So, after that completely homemade meal, what would I ask for? Well, as anyone who has met me knows, I love hugs, and try to get as many from as many people as possible. So, yeah, a big hug would be in order! Also, I would like to hear some of his stories, because I bet he has a lot of interesting ones. Lastly, I would ask for his completely honest opinion. Seriously, lay it on me, Chef. Was anything to over-mixed? Overcooked? Tell me all of that, but also
Now, if Chef had showed up tonight, completely famished and near exhaustion, he would have been having
Sure, I could also defrost some of my aforementioned Parker House Rolls (they freeze really well), and I?õ????d probably make him some sort of superfood smoothie (with more frozen fruit and veggies), after which he?õ????d probably collapse in our guest room. Now, I?õ????ll have to feed Chef breakfast, which would be
Before all of this, though, I?õ????d have to call my friend E, because she would never forgive me if I fed Chef Ramsay without her there.
She?õ????d probably want some pictures, and maybe for him to sign something.
I?õ????d just be so happy that I got to cook for a celebrity chef, I?õ????d phone up my grandma and tell her all about it!
Cheers!

What leverage does the Senate Intelligence committee have on Flynn?		
"Every time my boyfriend and I get into a fight (which he starts by the way), he threatens to kick me out, or he does kick me out, and I live two hours away. Is this OK?"	"Your boyfriend doesn't want to deal with you.
This is why he throws you out, your isssues (whatever they are) or rather
Which leads to a few conclusions:
Your boyfriend, might as well be abusive, or has absuive tendencies. If power and control are his aim, then watch out! That can't be proven, since you haven't provided many details about him or his behavior.
But from what you're experiencing, I can assure you this person is a nightmare to deal with, is incompatible with you (there's a lack of homogenous harmony in your relationship), and is more than likely self centered and in it for himself. The more pressure you put him under, the more he will dismiss you, until you become the bad guy in his eyes.
People, in healthy relationships treat each other as equals, rather than one person being on top or having more rights than the other. If they have issues, they discuss it and talk about it, there's an effort to communicate and solve problems together. Your boyfriend isn't interested in reaching a middle ground, he won't listen to you and it's much easier to just kick you out, eventually you'll feel misunderstood as the relationship progress. So, it's better to find someone that is more compatible with you, and is willing to listen.

What are some cowboy phrases?	"This?õ????d be accurate for 20th & 21st century cowboys, some of the phrases were 19th century as well. The older phrases have a lot more Spanish ranch jargon, simpler tools referenced, much more about their horses and surface water sources (usually no power but hand labor to pump water up out of shallow wells back then)
?õ????how many cow-calf pairs??õ???ù When you?õ????re building a herd or selling cattle to someone else building a herd, it?õ????s common to look at mother-unweaned child pairs both for demonstrated fertility and the calf can soon be reproducing as well so the pair might produce 3?õ????8 more cattle between the two of them over their breeding lives in as many years.

?õ????If I?õ????m gonna fix things around here it?õ????d be great to have some decent tools to do it?õ?????õ???ù
?õ????Did you see what they want for hay (or commercial feed) this year??õ???ù Often determines whether there will be any profit on the herd and if some of the herd needs to be sold immediately, at low prices, to mitigate the cash losses.
?õ????I can?õ????t believe how stupid this bunch of cows (or horses, sheep) is.?õ???ù
?õ????He?õ????s a helluva cattle dog, smartest hand on the whole place!?õ???ù Dogs do a lot of the work (and companionship) and are far cheaper than cowboys (and break less stuff.)

What is Marxism in China's particular environment?	"Marxism will show you that China is a Capitalist country and the CCP is at the head of the government, as a Marxist I can tell you China has developed the means by which Capitalism can be abolished, it could produce enough goods in abundance to satisfy the needs of its population and probably many other countries populations, the fact it doesn't is because it has a Capitalist economy where production is for profit, not the satisfying of human needs,the world now produces enough food to feed 10 billion people yet people starve,China will undoubtedly rumble on producing goods and services seeking forever more growth,like the rest of this Capitalist world we live in,until the workers of the world unite to abolish Capitalism and replace it with a global moneyless, stateless, wageless, classless society where production is for use not profit,

Is it possible a 4% week over week lifting weight increase?	"You have stumbled across the magic of NOOB GAINS here.
You see most beginners dont know how to lift and have not adjusted meaning that some training programs like starting strength have these increases as the program.
However they are called noob gains because your body is adjusting and developing to its natural ability after that it gets a lot harder.
The point this would stop depends entirely on the lifter, from experience its more likely that everyone will slow to a halt after about 8 months like this, however the results may vary.
For the human majority who did everything well in a great program they can expect to get roughly twice as strong as they were before lifting in that 8 month period.
BUT : what takes 8 months to get?õ????. to repeat will now take a couple years, and to get to to your peak it will probably take about 15?õ????20 years or never.
So to try and make the answer a bit more concise the point where most normal humans stop dead in linear progression (done right) is 8?õ????12 months, on weekly progression at higher percentages the time decreases depending on the individual to around 6 months to 8 months.
After that point:
as you say yourself the time frame and percentages can be altered.
This is one of many reasons that while I can explain things or answer I do not believe that people should go to someone like me to get programming and leave it to the people with experience in creating the work that can provide your best possible results.

If Allah is with Muslims then why are Muslim countries falling down?	"This is long and sad tale.
This is not unique to Islam. Many ?õ????Christian?õ???ù nations and Christian communities have suffered through periods of decline, division, fanaticism, and corruption. Indeed, Christianity suffered through an extended period called the Dark Ages and the Byzantine Empire was weakened by division and corruption leading up to the time of the coming of Muhammad, which is one of the reasons why Islamic Caliphate spread so quickly to Syria, Palestine and North Africa.
In more recent times, more ?õ????conservative,?õ???ù ?õ????extreme,?õ???ù and fanatic interpretations of Islam have often prevailed (Salafist teachings particularly) and caused the rise of corruption, including movements of late that pervert the very meaning and intent of Islam. There has developed within the Islamic community very intolerant and rigid beliefs and practices inconsistent with the values and morals of this modern age.
To date, much of Islamic scholarship and the Islamic community in the heart of Islam has not adequately adapted to this New Age and World that is developing. Seeing this, but believing to be morally superior, there is a resentment and lashing out at more developed and advanced civilizations of the world, especially given that fact that they are too materialistic, irreligious, and ?õ????immoral.?õ???ù There is a failure to understand that the sciences and freedoms of the more developed countries (including the values of democracy and tolerance) practiced in those countries constitute an advancement in civilization. Even if the materialism and personal immorality in such places is one form of corruption; the bribery, dishonestly, and venality all too common in the Islamic world is another form of corruption; both equally wrong but in different ways.

What is the use of Arduino?	"Arduino is a micro controller. It is used to physically interact with the environment in the way specified in the code uploaded on it.
Arduino is generally used in robotics, to build robots, techs, etc. You need to connect the components to Arduino and write appropriate code in c programming for Arduino to handle the connected components. Arduino will control it. It has input output pins which send currents as and when specified in the code by programmer. So you can tell Arduino like when to switch on led or turn it, use ultrasonic sensors, etc. All this is achieved through programming.

Is it a smart idea to study Computer Science if I don't want to work as a software developer?	"Sure it is. Many people who study for a certain degree end up working in a completely different field. The important thing to remember is that by choosing a certain path, you're not choosing a career - you're choosing a set of methodologies. A degree in computer science will do more than enhance your coding skills and prep you for a job as a developer; it will teach you valuable problem-solving skills and a set of chaining your ideas that you might not pick up otherwise. It will increase your ability in tackling hard problems (and even open-ended problems) and you will end up with an enviable set of skills to carry into whatever career you decide to venture in.

"Do people understand that the actual concern about the bathroom bill isn't with actual trans people, but people who pretend to be trans to be perverted?"	"For fucks sake, really?
I covered this last year:
So, for the guys in the back of the class that have been sleeping for the past
Let?õ????s stop for a moment and pretend I?õ????m not a trans woman. Let?õ????s pretend, instead, that I?õ????m someone who?õ????s taught
Anti-trans bathroom bills don?õ????t make women safer and they don?õ????t make children safer. Period. End of story.
The lie that?õ????s being sold to people stupid enough to believe it is that if you let trans people into the women?õ????s bathroom then cisgender guys will walk into the women?õ????s bathroom and, by virtue of claiming to be transgender, their presence will not be an early warning to women or children that they are in the presence of a predator.
Makes sense right?
Bathrooms are a place where women and children are assaulted. Happens all the time.
What makes a bathroom a high risk environment? More than anything else:
Bathrooms that are isolated make it less likely that a bystander will be alerted to an assault occurring which makes it a better target for predators. When building designers put restrooms at the end of long hallways, around corners or far back behind closed doors that isolate the restrooms from ?õ????public space?õ???ù?õ???? those are higher risk environments. Likewise, bathrooms in out of the way locations (rest stops, public parks, etc) create opportunities.
Two things happen when you have a bathroom that?õ????s isolated:
Look, I understand feeling threatened. Trust me, most trans people do, bathrooms scare the shit out of us (that?õ????s a research backed statement, not a personal anecdote, the trans population displays symptoms that mirror PTSD in how they deal with bathrooms.) Trans people know what it?õ????s like to be afraid to be assaulted in a bathroom. Lots of us have watched the
But letting trans people into bathrooms doesn?õ????t increase the risk women face in any significant way. The things that make bathrooms appealing targets for predators aren?õ????t changed by
I?õ????ve taught women?õ????s self defense for close to
Nothing, absolutely nothing, about the proposed legislation to stop trans people from using restrooms impacts any of the significant risk factors to women?õ????s safety. People who are repeating the line about this not being about trans people need to wake up and understand that they are being lied to, they are being taken advantage of, and their fear is being used to further other goals.
No where provides a better example of this than
So tell me, please, to my face, that HB2 was about bathrooms. Tell me that HB2 removed the right of cities to establish minimum wages within their jurisdiction because it kept women safer. Tell me that it stopped people of color from bringing discrimination cases to state courts because it made women safer.
Or, stop believing the rhetoric. Recognize that anti-trans bathroom bills aren?õ????t about making women safer. They are successful tools for mobilizing voters that capitalize on the anti-LGBT sentiment conservative politicians built over the last several years while fighting same sex marriage. They present opportunities to advance
I don?õ????t honestly believe that bathroom bills are motivated by anti-trans hatred, at least, not at the legislator level. I don?õ????t think that legislators hate us that badly or are introducing these bills in a calculated attempt to force transgender people out of public life.
I do think that trans people make a convenient target for advancing other goals. I do think that, behind the legislators are influential lobbyist groups that are encouraging legislators to introduce these laws and I do believe that
The rhetoric that?õ????s spun in favor of these laws is calculated. Legislators are taking a public stand that ?õ????this isn?õ????t about trans people?õ???ù because if they took that stand they know they?õ????d get torn down fast for being discriminatory bigots. Saying ?õ????it?õ????s about women?õ????s safety, not about trans people?õ???ù gives them a convenient shield to hide behind. They may even believe it. Meanwhile, other interested groups are fanning the flames of anti-LGBT hatred to encourage popular support for these bills.
So, maybe I?õ????d agree?õ???? this isn?õ????t about trans people even though it has devastating effects on transgender citizens. But it sure as hell isn?õ????t about protecting women because it doesn?õ????t do a damn thing to make women or children safer.

How does one optimize drawing directly on Stage in Animate CC?	"The question is a little vague, but the best way to produce clean drawings in a software program is to use a drawing stylus or tablet rather than a mouse. Wacom tablets are good for beginner use. Most professionals use the Cintiq drawing desk, which allows the artist to draw directly on the screen.
When starting out, line quality is usually jagged. Try practicing drawing smooth curves in strokes, or use bezier curves and vector lines. Pressure sensitivity and custom brushes might help.

Why do your knees hurt when doing squats?	"There are a number of ligaments and two minisci at the knee. Aside from an xray, you will need a professional to run a provocative test on you to specify which one in particular is triggering the pain.
Then, there are also structural issues that may lead to the knee sprains, namely the hip and ankles joints. Any abnormal joint angles at those two areas can add the extra stress.
Third is the improper training procedure. You could be squatting above suggested depth (hip crease align with knees), causing more stress to the knees (according to IG: squatuniversity. Highly recommend following them.)
And even proper depth (from my personal experience) allows some room for compensation. You can easily add an extra rep or two by caving your knees together. Add a double ply sleeve combine with egotism and you're just asking for a complete ACL tear.

What would Saint Patrick think of leprechauns?	"Ah leprechauns, the little green mischievous spirits of the Emerald Isle. Needless to say, St. Patrick would be rather upset. You see, don?õ????t get St. Patrick wrong. Well actually, probably most celebrators of St. Patrick?õ????s Day at least in the United States only DO get St. Patrick wrong. Or else worse, unconsciously associate St. Patrick to be
This is what you should know about St. Patrick. Patrick was born in Britain in the 5th century and captured by pagan Irish slavers around the age of 16. Escaping captivity and returning to Britain he received a vocation from God to become a Roman Catholic priest and convert the poor pagan of Ireland. Receiving support, he did so and did so marvelously. He was fearless against his pagan enemies, worked many miracles, and converted thousands of people and is citied to have effectively converted all of Ireland.
One of the more notable stories of St. Patrick concerns a pagan feast. Let us observe how St. Patrick carried himself concerning paganism. On the Feast of the Annunciation March 25th 433 A. D. the King of Tara ordered that all fires within his kingdom be extinguished that night until his Druid priests lit a signal fire the next morning in celebration of a certain pagan feast. As this was the day before Easter Sunday in that year, St. Patrick lit the traditional Pachal fire for the vigil of Easter feast that night in defiance of the king?õ????s degree on the hill of Slane, at the opposite side of the valley from Tara. The king?õ????s Druid priests seeing this fire urged the king to order chariots out to go out and extinguish the fire and kill the person who lit it. Being a very superstitious lot, knowing it was the day before the Christian Easter feast, and facing a lot of trouble from the increase of conversions to Catholicism in the their kingdom said :
The King dispatched his chariots but unable to outrace the rising sun, failed to extinguish the fire before daybreak and Patrick evaded their attempts to kill him. St. Patrick in his full episcopal garb then processed to Tara and challenged the pagan Druids. The Druids, chanting incantations, summoned a cloud of darkness over the valley covering over the Easter sun so to maintain their sway over the Irish people. St. Patrick then challenged them to remove the cloud of darkness they had summoned, but they could not. St. Patrick then prayed to God and the cloud was suddenly swept away and sun shone very clearly. The Arch-Druid Lochru, considered with near divine honors by the Irish then challenged Patrick demonstrating that he could ?õ????ascend to heaven?õ???? rising from the ground as with flight. Again St. Patrick prayed to God and the Druid fell to the earth, dashed to pieces on a nearby rock before the gathered company. The King of Tara and his queen were eventually converted by these events and various other marvels even as St. Patrick survived many attempts on his life.
If St. Patrick did anything he loved God, loved the Irish and Ireland, and hated paganism. Read this portion of St. Patrick?õ????s Breastplate, a traditional Irish prayer attributed to St. Patrick:
?õ????God?õ????s heavenly host to be my guard
?õ????
Against incantations of false prophets,
Against black laws of pagandom,
Against false laws of heretics,
Against craft of idolatry,
Against spells of witches and smiths and wizards,
Against every knowledge that corrupts man's body and soul;
Christ to shield me today
Against poison, against burning,
Against drowning, against wounding,
Protect me, Christ, till Thy returning.?õ???ù
In the conversion of Ireland, this Apostle to the Emerald Isle was very hardcore anti-pagan.?ˇ Would St. Patrick tolerate the creeping in of a little Celtic faery so essentially closely into his feast??ˇ I say not.?ˇ It is largely harmless of course, but still there exists a strong uneasiness between the Christian essence of St. Patrick and little magical fantasy beings we call leprechauns.?ˇ At the very least, St. Patrick would be justly upset by the secularization of his holy day and the reversal of his life?õ????s work and mission.

Was the Hawker Sea Fury the best piston engine fighter?	"At first pass, I have precisely the same conundrum as Filip.
On second thought, I'd ask for more clarification to your question?õ????. For example, best high altitude interceptor, best dog-fighter, best bomber escort, best Naval carrier fighter, best night fighter?
For Naval carrier fighters; Sea Fury (if F7F Tigercat and F8F Bearcat excluded from consideration). If they are not excluded, then I have another conundrum?õ????
Best high altitude interceptor; P-47 M or Ta-152 - possibly going to the Ta-152 because the P-47 was really a long range offensive weapon (fighter/bomber, bomber escort) and because of the Fockwulf?õ????s rate of climb and cannon ( very effective against bombers).
For best night fighter, I?õ????m thinking it?õ????s another three way conundrum between HE-219 Owl, P-61 Black Widow and Mosquito?õ????.

How many eggs should I eat each day?	"A whole egg contains:
It is recommended to consume not more than 15 grams of saturated fat everyday.
It is also recommended that if you are perfectly healthy, not more than 300 mg of cholesterol should come from food.
Now, as far as the saturated fat is concerned, you can have 2?õ????3 eggs everyday. But because of high cholesterol, I would not suggest you to have more than 1 whole egg each day.
Also, in our daily life we cook vegetables in oil, consume dairy products etc which are anyway high in saturated fat and cholesterol. Hence, eating 2?õ????3 whole eggs everyday may harm you in the long run.
Egg whites on the other hand contain nothing but protein. You can have as many egg whites as you want to in a day. However, it is very difficult to eat egg whites alone because of their bland taste.

He taught me how to use it and told me it's called a fukin calculator so I used it.And voila to my surprise it displayed the answer.

Can you destroy an enemy tank by opening the hatch and dropping a grenade inside?	"Hmm..
Recognizing this is not a movie nor a computer game is the first step in understanding this is a high-risk feat to be accomplished:
First you need to get close enough to the tank to mount it without being discovered. If you are discovered by the tank or other forces, well, your friends will miss you dearly.
Then you have to mount the tank - beware - it's quite tall and most places and angles don't accommodate for easy climbing. Oh, and the tank might abruptly drive over you. If that happens, your friends will miss you dearly.
Now that you mounted the tank be sure to bring all your limbs up onto the turret from the hull?õ????s deck before the turret rotates - it may rapidly rotate at any moment with great mechanical force either intentionally to get that pesky climber off the tank, or by chance. If you're lucky you'll be thrown off the tank. If you're less lucky, you'll be leaving some parts of yourself behind, or get squashed in a novel way. Your friends will miss you dearly.
Ok, now you?õ????re ?õ????riding the bull?õ???ù and holding for dear life
Another thing - tanks usually don?õ????t hang out alone - exactly because of initiatives such as yours, tanks keep friends chilling in the vicinity for mutual protection - the friendlies may be other tanks, and/or other forces. If your?õ????e spotted at any stage, another tank is more than ok to fire 7.62 / 0.5?õ???? rounds
So pretending the tank has no friendly-friendlies about to help it, assuming you know how to open the hatch and are sunbathing in the cool breeze on the top of the turret, you are left with actually opening the hatch and throwing in a grenade: Taking a pin out of a grenade requires two hands (breaking your teeth is a-movie-only option). Most if not all hatches require two hands to open as well. You choose what to do first - first open, than take pin out, or first take pin out, secure the unsafe grenade in one hand
So lastly - if you managed to dunk the grenade in, AND not get shot AND move away from the hatch opening, you?õ????ll be spending the next 3 seconds - probably the longest three seconds of your life - praying the crew doesn?õ????t manage to toss the grenade outside (the chances are that they won?õ????t manage this - almost impossible) then hear a thump, followed by losing some of your hearing, and voila: grenade dunking hero: 1 tank:0.

"Which school is a better fit for a bioengineering major, MIT or Berkeley (Regents Scholar)?"	"Berkeley has a long tradition in medicine.
MIT has the number one in engineering.
The thing is bioengineering is now 70% of MIT, and MIT is now half women and half men. When I went it was 90% men and 10% women. The change inside MIT has been dramatic, as has been the technical bioengineering world.
Universities like Berkeley and Harvard are slow to change, medicine and law, for example, are fields that see say an MIR or CT scan as a way of seeing things in the body. At MIT an MRI is a machine that is being reduced to the size of a device that can be implanted into the body, runs on batteries and reports changes when appropriate.
But many aspects of medicine stick to the tried and true, as should be. For example, the first drug for diabetes is metformin, a pill made from a plant that has been know for over 4,000 years, when animals would avoid it cause it made them lose weight. The first drug for gout painful attacks is also 4,000 years old, colchicine, another plant.
Compare that to bioengineering, where microminiaturization is moving at tremendous speeds?õ????every few months another development, more patents, just like computers doubling the speed every year.
MIT is equiped for that change, engineers seek new areas because by design, since once a device is manufactured, the engineer is no longer needed. Like when NASA let go of many engineers after we landed on the moon. And the engineers go towards the new developments that are needing improvement.
MIT is a robotic machine filled with hard core mathematically gifted freaks that gobble a technical problem as fast as walking through its infinite corridor, as you walk from mechanical engineering to electrical engineering to virtual movie areas and you can just knock on the door or the professors and students and land them a challenge. Majors at MIT are flexible. Many students spend years in special projects.
You do not get that flexibility in medicine schools, which by nature have to be cautious.
So the answer is MIT, by far. With some exceptions.

SEBI registered venture funds will contribute this Rs. 10,000 crore Fund of Funds which in turn will finance the startups. Please click here for the
You can approach these venture funds to contribute.
Tips on approaching and convincing your VCs-
You must prepare the presentation you will give to your VCs. Be thorough and clear. Practice several times beforehand. The key is to keep it short and interesting. Give highlights of your products/service and how it will benefit your customers. How it is different from your competitors. Be thoroughly prepared so that you can answer any question the VC may have regarding your business.
2. See if you have any connections
Check your professional network if you have any connections with the VC. Ask your connection to introduce you to the VC.
3. Research
Conduct your own research on the VC. What kind companies is he interested in? He might tweet that an article about rise of fintech companies. If your startup is a fintech company, he might be interested.
4. Attend startup fests
Startup fests are becoming popular and provide excellent networking opportunities. You can meet potential investors, partners at these fests.
5. Be patient
While you might not be able to convince your VC, keep your chin up. Many startups have started on their own funds. By keeping a narrow market, good products/services, tight control on expenses, they have managed to grow. Then it is easier to approach a VC on better terms for yourself.

How can I convert a decimal into a mixed number?	"First, you need to convert it into a fraction.
Take your decimal and move the decimal point to the right until it becomes a whole number (ex: 1.04 ?õ???? 104). That number is your numerator. Now, wrote down ?õ????1?õ???ù, then for every time you had to move the decimal point to make the decimal a whole number, add a 0 to the end of it. That?õ????s your denominator (ex: for 1.04 ?õ???? 104, you had to move the decimal to the right 2 times, so your denominator is 100. So your fraction in full is 104/100). Now you need to simplify your fraction (ex: 104/100 = 26/25).
Now we have an improper fraction. To convert it to a mixed number, take the numerator and divide it by the denominator, but don?õ????t go into decimals, just get a whole number and record the remainder (ex: 26/25 = 1 with a remainder of 1). The quotient is the whole number to the left of the fraction, the remainder is your new numerator and the denominator stays the same.
So, 1.04 = 1 + (1/25)

Other Tomb-Sweeping Day festivities include flying kites, eating (of course!), and venturing out into nature to appreciate warmer weather.
Tomb-Sweeping Day activities are an expression of filial piety, or respect for one?õ????s elders. Dragon Boat Festival is also about filial piety and fealty.
The story goes that in China?õ????s famed Warring States period, a minister drowned himself in a river after learning his capital city was captured by adversarial forces. Locals who admired him rushed out into the river in boats searching for his body. When they couldn?õ????t find him, they dropped balls of sticky rice into the water so that the fish would hit the rice and not the minister?õ????s body.
Zongzi, a type of sticky rice ball, is traditionally eaten during the festival. There are many regional variations on the dish, so try them all if you visit!

What is a solution or a software for team management and tracking?	"*disclaimer: I work here*
Having said that, if I ran a team on my own, I would still be using
Avaza has project management, time tracking, quotes/estimates, expenses and invoices. You can run business reports, plus you can invite as many project collaborators as you want to your projects.
The free plan offers full access to the platform, but it is

Once you?õ????re done with the project, all you need to do to bill you client is click a button to import all timesheet entries, fixed billable amounts and expenses related to that project into one invoice and you can send this to your client as a web-based invoice or as PDF. You client can also pay you online (using Credit card or Paypal).
Try it out, I?õ????ve tried not to give more information than you need, but it is a super awesome tool for collaborative teams who want a cloud-based platform where they can work on projects together :)

In India, there are only 2 ways to get an arms license;

In order to get an arms license under this category, you need to have qualified for two National Shooting Championships. Once you have achieved this, the National Rifle Association will give you a
Along side this certificate, one has to submit 20?õ????30 other documents (proof of birth, adress, passport copy, aadhar etc) to the Commissioner of Police?õ????s is office. These documents take a couple of months to process. After this, you are called for an interview to the local police office where you have to state on record the purpose of getting your license.
Then the police run a background check on you and will make several visit to your adress, they will get charachter statements from your neighbours and they even give you phone calls to your house in order to enure that the adress you provided is 100% real.
Finally, after 6?õ????7 months you will recieve a license which allows you to import upto 12 0.22/0.32 pistols (with no custom duty charge)
However the pistols can (obviously) only be used by me for sports purposes! In order to import a foreign pistol (like a Glock or 1911) or a top quality sports pistol the import process can take a further 12 months.

Why do people get stuck in life?	"I am having dinner with a friend who is saying she has not found a significant other and is running out of time.
She?õ????s in her early thirties.
I can understand why she feels this way but the fact is she has all the time in the world.
Her believing time is running out makes her come at this from a place of anxiety, tension, desperation.
She is defeated. She is defeated, and she has not begun.
Is trying something and failing an indication it will never work?
Is there no value in trying again? Isn?õ????t perseverance the key to success?

Could a human armed with a spear win against a chimpanzee?	"Building off of
Spears are used for LARGE prey. You use spears to hunt bears, elephants, lions and hippos, if you?õ????re feeling froggy (please under no circumstances do this, the hippo will kill you and barely notice). Animals that charge and build up a lot of momentum are great for spears. For something more agile, though, a spear is less useful once you?õ????re within the spear?õ????s reach. Chimps are very agile. You need something with less reach and more reaction time.
Also, when a chimp attacks you, it likes to get up close and personal. It bashes heads against things. It bites, it rips. A hand axe is ideal for this kind of combat, because you might not even see the little bastard until he?õ????s too close for spears.

"Who do you feel is a highly underrated actor in modern cinema, and deserves more recognition?"	"Joaquin Phoenix
I think he?õ????s a superb actor who is a no-nonsense type of guy. He simply wants to make art with his work. I knew from the moment I hated his character in
Joaquin Phoenix?õ????s life, I believe, is art itself. He defines his own life, and no one else. On 2008, he declared that he had retired from acting in order to become a rapper. But unbeknownst to anyone, he was actually filming a mockumentary,
He lives on top of the Hollywood Hills; befitting his style!
When he got into a car crash on 2006, the person who saved him was legendary director, Werner Herzog. If that, in it of itself, does not make for a grand story, then I don?õ????t know what does!
He also never sticks to a genre he?õ????s comfortable acting in, but rather spreads out his roles to showcase his versatility!
I truly believe this man deserves more recognition for the life he brings to Hollywood and the world!

Why trains in India are so late?	"From a my understanding of how the train traffic is handled in India Believe me when I say this, ?õ????Trains if they are late, there is a justifiable reason behind it?õ???ù.
Unlike the perception in public,trains run late NOT because of any improper planning or shortcomings in administration or because of the ?õ????employees who don't do their job?õ???ù. Infact in Railways
As a matter of fact, this particular experience is because Railways gives topmost priority to safety. Some main reasons that causes delays to trains are:
Over the long network of railway track, any delay anywhere, if they can't be made up by running, will be carried over enroute. These just add up over a long distances like small errors adding up to become a big error.
This is how things work, I know it's highy inconvenient for the passengers but given the inadequacies in which our system work I would say they are doing their best.

"Which team is stronger, Real or Bayern?"	"Breaking down the starting 11 of both teams:
GK:
Neuer vs Navas or Ulreich vs Navas?
Neuer is miles ahead of Navas, without a doubt.
Although we must note that Neuer is currently nursing a toe injury and may not be able to recover in time for the first leg at the Allianz Arena. Sven Ulreich, the former Stuttgart keeper, will deputise in his absence. Navas, given his recent form is on par with Ulreich.
Verdict: 1?õ????0 in favour of Bayern ( should Neuer recover, very likely)
Defenders:
Sergio Ramos and Pepe vs Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels
Arguably, both these world class duos are the best in their leagues, they're neck and neck. However that's true with respect to just defending.
Offensively, we all know who holds the aces here. Captain, leader, legend, Sergio Ramos drags Madrid ahead in this scenario. In their previous encounter at the Allianz Arena, the set piece threat headed home 2 goals and was the difference between the two. However, Bayern have been brilliant at defending set pieces this season having acquired the services of the aerially strong defender Hummels.
Marcelo vs Alaba
The much debated argument on the best left backs in Europe boils down to the very same individuals. The last time the two faced off, Alaba was a mere shadow of his truer potential, while Marcelo was at the peak of his game. 3 years hence, age has caught up with Marcelo while Alaba is in his prime. Given the way Marcelo was exposed down the left flank by Inaki Williams in their last encounter against Athletic Bilbao, one can say Alaba gives Bayern the advantage here.
Carvajal vs Lahm
Carvajal is Real Madrid's underrated superstar. He's quietly gone about his job and is expected to be the leading right back of his generation along with Hector Bellerin. Like in their previous encounter, he's perfectly capable of nullifying Ribery or Costa or Coman. On the other hand the slower Lahm will find it difficult against the quick, agile and skillful Ronaldo.
Verdict: 1?õ????0 yet.
Midfielders:
Kroos and Modric have been instrumental in Madrid?õ????s standing at the top of the La Liga. To their success has been vital young Casemiro. He has silently gone about his business like he showed against Barcelona in the Classico against the likes of Messi and is likely to prove to be the difference between the two teams. Bayern would most probably go in with a 4?õ????2?õ????3?õ????1 with Vidal and Thiago Alcantara playing a deeper role and Muller donning the central midfield and Ribery/Costa and Robben on the flanks
Verdict: In this area, Real hold a slight advantage and so, they've equalized 1?õ????1.
Attack:
BBC vs R^3
Bale, Benzema and Cristiano vs Robert Lewandowki, Robben and Ribery promises to be an exciting clash. Which way this is going to go could be anyone's guess really.
Final verdict: Not much separating the teams, so it's incredibly hard to decide which team is stronger. One might argue that Bayern is still adapting to the Ancelotti style of play or that Real's bench strength is much stronger, but this is the very team Ancelotti moulded and no one knows Real better than the man himself, Don Carlo.

Why is it not right to assassinate an oppressing dictator to help millions of people?	"Interesting question, I'll give it a go.
So let's ignore the thinking that it's wrong to kill. For killing one man will save millions.
At first killing the dictator will mean that everyone is freed right? Time for progress and no longer being under the rule of one man! Hurrah!
Instead it goes to a turmoil of a power struggle between opposing parties and individuals. Take out a dictator and who's going to rule? A puppet leader? An opposition party? A military general?
Are these rebel fighters going to get control of their country?
Or are these government soldiers above are going to restore order back into their country?
Will a rouge general assume control of the nation with his military?
Or will a third party group that are extremists tsk control?
Next, do you want any of these groups to take control? And how do you think they'll treat the nation?
And how will the dictator be removed? Politically? Voted out, arrested? Or worse.
Gaddafi was killed off by his own people. In the aftermath, the country went into turmoil and has become a ground for extremist groups and a place for migrants to make the jump into Europe.
Huessain was hanged to death in front of his people. From that point, Iraq has still not recovered.
By killing off the dictator, more lives are lost, more destruction is at hand, more chaos ensures.
(This doesn't go for all countries that have had a dictator but it's for most)

"I'm a Jewish Mexican author who wants to write about a Navajo character. Would that be ok, and what stereotypes/issues should I look out for?"	"This isn?õ????t quite the answer you asked for, but hopefully my questions for you will help you find out the answer to your question:
Is it imperative that your character be Navajo? Could your character be any other ethnicity without significant impact? If so, consider other options you might have.
How is in-depth is your knowledge of Navajo culture and customs? Do you know enough about the Navajo tribe to write, intimately understand, and give life and credibility to a Navajo character? Do you know what it is like to be Navajo? I'm unsure of what setting your story will take place under - do you need to be familiar with modernity?õ????s effects on Navajo people? If you are unsure about which stereotypes to be aware of in fleshing out a Navajo character then perhaps you should refine your understanding (which this question seems to be intended for, so good job!) The best resource for you might be real Navajo people.
That being said, people are people, whether or not they are Navajo. Ask yourself: what is your character?õ????s relationship to their ethnicity? Can you represent your character as a real and developed person who happens to be Navajo? How much knowledge of Navajo people do you need to convey the experiences you wish to convey? Is your character more familiar with the Navajo culture than you are? If so, maybe avoid this character until you know more.
I am not Navajo so I cannot give you specific advice - and I also am unable to give you any sort of ?õ????permission.?õ???? Perhaps you should research whether there are any overarching ?õ????rules?õ???? that the Navajo tribe has established about depictions in fiction. Figure out whether there is any critique of other depictions of the Navajo in media and do your best to avoid previous mistakes. However, I will say that if your character is rendered justly, appropriately, empathetically, and accurately, few people should take issue.

Why are Trump's speeches and writings so primitive? Does he have a low IQ?	"Speaking is more skill and experience than talent.
I have observed the transformation of many fledgling political orators. They begin as stiff, lifeless, and cliched, and five years later they hold the attention of a room and say things worth hearing. It is a pleasure to observe.
Certainly, some are endowed with more linguistic gifts. While Donald Trump?õ????s IQ is a fun topic of snarky speculation, I have no doubt that had he desired, he once could have become a competent and even superior speaker.
At his age, he probably does not possess much extra capacity for growth away from the teleprompter. However, his performance as a speaker is limited by two more significant factors.
First, Donald Trump is not a reader. Readers are regularly exposed to grammatical constructions, uncommon words, and original thoughts that influence speech. Trump?õ????s vocabulary and phrasing are confined to what he is exposed to in casual conversation.
Secondly, he never needed to develop his skill. His entire adult life has consisted of lording over people he paid. He never reported to a board of directors. He never had to dazzle a boss or outshine a coworker. Hundred-dollar words were not much use to him.
Donald Trump is a bad speaker because he has had nothing to gain from becoming a good one.

Life is totally meaningless. We live. We die. So what's the point?	"Human-beings are given the ability to create our own meaning. We write our narratives in our minds. If you want to make your life mean something, you?õ????re in control of that. Just let things in life mean something to you and they will. You don?õ????t need an external source to tell you life?õ????s point, use your brain and craft one for yourself.
So life is a game. We?õ????re playing the human game. The human game has many different sub-games, there?õ????s the banker game, the stay at home mom game, the politician game, etc. If you invest in one of these games, it will give your life meaning. The more you invest, the more the victories will mean to you.
Think about an Olympian crying because they got the Gold Medal. In the bigger scheme of things does that mean something? Not really, but it means something to them because they were so invested in that game.
So pick a game and play it the best you can, even though you will die, you can at least have fun trying playing one of the many games life has to offer.
So don?õ????t take everything so seriously; we?õ????re here so we might as well have fun with it. We all live and die, but that?õ????s what makes our lives mean something. The fact that any of it happened at all is what makes life valuable.

Can reading the original Ramayana clear me from Christianity?	"Don?õ????t worry about clearing you from anything. You should study something for the sake of knowledge. I am posting some reading material for you to learn about Hinduism.
You should read a low level introductory book that nevertheless gives a decent overview of Hinduism. Otherwise you will have difficulty in understanding Hindu scriptures. Books like 'The Hindu mind' by Bansi Pandit and 'The complete Idiot's guide to Hinduism' by Linda Johnsen would help. Another introductory text is 'A primer of Hinduism' by D. S. Sharma. A good text is 'Essentials of Hinduism' by Swami Bhaskarananda. A good survey of Hindu scriptures is 'Windows into the Infinite A guide to the Hindu scriptures' by Barbara Powell. An advanced level beginner text is 'The Spiritual Heritage of India' by Swami Prabhavananda.
You can then read some of the seminal texts of Hinduism like the Gita, the Upanishads and if you are really interested in the Brahma Sutra. You can read the Gita translated by Swami Tapasyananda. You can also read ?õ????Universal Message of the Bhagavad Gita: An Exposition of the Gita in the light of Modern thought and Modern Needs?õ???? by Swami Ranganathananda. If you want to go really deep into it then commentaries of Sankara on the Gita, the Upanishads and the Brahma Sutra are a must. You can read Srimad Bhagavad Gita Bhasya of Sri Sankaracharya translated by Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier. You can also read Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sri Sankaracharya translated by Swami Gambhirananda. Reading the translations of Upanishads by Swami Nikhilananda and Swami Gambhirananda will also be helpful.You will find many Hindu seminal texts on online sites. There is a list in one of the questions here.
You can then read the 9 volume Vivekananda's complete works if you have the time for it. If not, then I recommend 'What religion is in the words of Swami Vivekananda' edited by Swami Vidyatmananda. You can also read Patanjali's Yoga Sutra.
If you have the time for it then you can go through the entire Mahabharata which is full of gems. You can try reading K. M. Ganguli's translation of the Mahabharata. You can also read the translation of Srimad Bhagavataam by Swami Tapasyananda.
Till now you have gained theoretical knowledge. If you have the time then you can go through the Ramakrishna Kathamrita (translated as the 'The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna) to read about an exemplar of the Hindu tradition.
You can go to any Ramakrishna Vedanta Center to learn about Hindu scripture. You can find out about the Centers at the following web site:
I have given the list that I found useful. It is definitely inclined towards Advaita. You will need to read commentaries of Hindu seminal texts by other Acharyas if you are interested in other Vedantic traditions.
I have not talked about the 4 Vedic Samhitas because I have not come across unbiased commentaries on them.

How many times does AC current change its polarity in one second?	"F = 50,
It means, in 0.02 second one cycle is complete.
In one cycle 2 time AC change its polarity.
So,
And
So 50 Hz AC change its polarity is 100 time.
In other word 50Hz means in a one second 50 cycle is complete.
And in AC 1 cycle 2 time polarity change

The vast majority of the students who intend to pursue studies in the fields of Science or Engineering, spend the first two years (sometimes more) of their tertiary education attending the (in)famous?ˇ
Beyond the strict curriculum with a strong emphasis on theory and on rigorous demonstrations, the fierce competition often drives the student to surpass themselves and very few universities in the world can boast entrance exams as hard as those of the best french schools.
From a certain point of view, it's one of the most meritocratic selection processes in the world, even if it doesn't lack detractors and critics. Many think, in fact, that the academic or professional career of someone shouldn't be determined almost exclusively by a the ability to solve complex Mathematics problem at twenty or criticize the excessive emphasis on mathematics at the cost of other important skills.
Whether this is true or not, France still has an extremely hard Mathematics curriculum and can boast significantly more Fields Medals per capita than any other country.

Why can't people see or accept the truth clearly?	"Because the model we use for knowledge, known as the Tripartite Theory of Knowledge is a long broken model. It relies on truth, justification, and belief for knowledge to exist. However, knowledge is not based on truth. It is based on what we observe through five sense. This is our justification for all knowledge, and our observations can be good or bad. And the conclusions we reach based on them can be good or bad.
However, please note - a key aspect of mankind?õ????s knowledge base is that it does not withstand evidence of falsehood. Yet evidence of falsehood is not the equal to truth.
And finally, on an individual basis, evidence of falsehood can be personally denied. Yes, people can choose to live in denial and often do.

Why didn't Nazi submarines sink Allied ships carrying soldiers on D-Day?	"Because the Allies put a heavy blanket of air cover and escorting warships around the invasion fleet (the minesweeping effort alone, clearing the assembly areas and routes to the beaches, involved over 350 ships) and laid minefields to protect their flanks, which meant that any of the surviving, available U-boats that tried to approach the area were going to have extremely exciting - and, probably, rather short - lives there.
From memory there were one or two losses among the protecting warships to torpedo boats (none to submarines) but while the Germans tried to nibble on the edge they couldn?õ????t break through. After the landings, several types of midget submarines attempted attacks, but they were generally more dangerous to their crews than their targets and again, they achieved very little against the heavy interdiction.

Is getting multiple degrees like CA-CS-CMA really useful for corporate job?	"Before I discuss the main question, there are certain things that needs to be discussed and made clear, so that we can understand the situation better.
The answer to this question can be easily observed by the syllabus that we learn. In Primary school, we learn how to read & write. Thereafter from Class 1 to Class 10, we learn the various aspects of life that every human being needs to know to behave rationally for e.g. Geography gives us knowledge about the places in world, Physics helps us understanding the forces of nature, History gives us knowledge about the past of human beings and how we reached here, so that we can assess what can happen in future, etc.
After 10th, we have different streams - Arts, Science & Commerce. Thereon, people choose various different degrees like Engineering, Doctoring, Architecture, etc. If you notice, this is the first time after a decade of education that we get a chance in life where we can choose which type of subjects we really want to study. Why do we have this choice? Because the basic knowledge that every human being should have is already attained when we pass Class 10, thereafter, it is our choice to choose what we want to become.
Unfortunately, this decision is taken on insignificant factors, which I am not discussing, but
In past, there was no basic education and potters made their child potter, farmers made their child farmer and so on. But as time passed, need for basic education was felt to become a good human and thereon, first basic education and then higher education, became the formula.
In ancient times, everyone used to work for themselves, but now in modern world we have Service Sector which is considered to be the heart of every economy. Service Sector means job - people are hired to work. It is easy to choose amongst 10 people, if we need 10 people. However, if we have 1000 choices, and we need only 10, the situation complicates. How to decide then? Try any technique you won?õ????t be able to hire good employees since you don?õ????t know how good he/she is, unless the person who has taught him/her, certifies that the person is good, better, best or as per the standard requirement. This is what we call ?õ????Degrees?õ????.
Why are ISO certifications necessary? Because it confirms that the company has the standard capabilities. Why do we have Green/Red mark on future? Because it explains its contents whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian. Why do we have Audits? Because it certifies that Financial Statements are true & fair. Similarly, we have degrees because they certify your knowledge and in some cases skills. Now it is important to have this certificate in your pocket because then you can show it to the world - ?õ????See I am Bcom Graduate. So I know the basics of Commerce.?õ???ù and so on. On that basis you can get jobs and if you are self-employed Professional then you can get clients.
Now I come to the question.
There are three reasons,
In all the three cases, the main aim, the goal is - recognition (work life). If you are specialized in some area, then companies which need a person with specialization in that area will hire you. If you have a combination of two areas, companies who need a person with knowledge of two areas will hire you. If you do it for disaster management and your nightmare turns true, then still you have recognition of Bcom alongwith the
I have already explained in the above important para - Degrees get recognition - Recognition gets you opportunities - Opportunities then needs to be identified - Identified opportunities need to be grabbed - Thereafter, Opportunities get you success, if you apply enough efforts. And all this can happen only to a good people. So you also need to be a good person.
Now I know there might be some biased opinions who will comment ?õ????My X did CA + CS, but all in vain, he did not get anything better.?õ???ù
My dear friend, degrees get you opportunities, but you also need to

Many historians believe the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was the biggest mistake in military history. What are your views on this?	"With the benefit of hindsight, it?õ????s easy to say that the attack on Pearl Harbor was a mistake. So what was Admiral YAMAMOTO Isoroku thinking? What led to the attack?
My answer is the
The quagmire in China spurred Japan to invade Southeast Asia, as they were running low on resources. The gamble was that a preemptive attack on the United States would shock and deter the United States from intervening in Southeast Asia. Look at the timeline: the invasion of Malaya began on December 8, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor.
To really see why it all goes back to the quagmire in China, work backwards from the embargo argument. The embargo argument is that Japan had to attack the U.S. because the U.S. froze Japanese assets and banned exports. But as
Planning for the attack predated the asset freeze and the oil embargo, therefore the asset freeze and the oil embargo
Now think about it this way. If the war in China had gone as Japan had expected, Japan would have had full control over China by the end of 1937 at the latest. So why would Japan have cared if the U.S. froze Japanese assets and banned oil exports between July and August 1941? If you have complete control over Chinese resources, I don?õ????t think you care about losing oil exports from the U.S.
And if you have complete control over Chinese resources, you don?õ????t need to rush an invasion of Southeast Asia to get resources. No invasion of Southeast Asia, no need to take a gamble and preemptively attack the U.S. as a ?õ????back off?õ???ù warning. So it all goes back to the fact that Japan had been stuck in China for way longer than they were expecting.

Can a cougar defeat a grizzly bear in a fight?	"Cougars are some of the meanest, most dangerous and savage predators to be found in north America. They tend to attack the genitals and they often carry pepper spray.
Cougars and bears often target the same prey. However, that prey is generally only vulnerable to predation by one OR the other (although some prey may fall victim to either, especially when drunk).
In the wild, most of the bears a cougar will encounter won?õ????t be grizzly. Indeed, they will be quite the opposite. As such, a physical altercation is unlikely.
If a fight DID happen, while a cougar may not defeat a bear, she would probably beat one off given the opportunity.

What happens to children that grow up with a superstitious parent?	"I don?õ????t think superstitions are a problem until and unless they are really extreme. If you take a minute and think about it superstitions are not bad either.
According to me superstitions are just theories based on certain things which caused certain outcomes repeatedly making people believe that the thing always leads to that outcome.Basically, superstitions were in olden days a way in which people could prevent other people from doing something implying the ?õ????fear of god?õ????.
Now here?õ????s the interesting part. Most of the time superstitions didn?õ????t turn out to be a disadvantage as most of the superstitions were proven as science later. (weather, banned food in certain countries, covering your mouth while sneezing or soul escapes etc.)
Here is an interesting pattern most of us have observed. Science and God have a certain proportionality at all times. Basically, before whatever people couldn?õ????t comprehend, people would name it as God?õ????s grace or God is angry on us. Lets just go to the start of human history before fire was invented. Fire was God?õ????s way of being angry in many scriptures. Then came the God?õ????s travelling and slaying various fierce animals. God?õ????s travelling on an instrument without an animal. Communicating without being face to face with a certain person. God?õ????s flying using a certain machine/instrument and it goes on and on.
What i mean to say is that these beliefs aren?õ????t completely useless. Things like gut feeling can be closely related to the higher consciousness described in various mythologies.
What if certain superstitions do turn true in the future. Of course I am not talking about the stupid ones where in they have no logic whatsoever. I am talking about the ones like neurology and palmistry which are believed to be superstitious. ( Not just these but any other customs). Not that I endorse superstitions but its just my theory that in future they might turn out to be science.

"Psychology of Everyday Life: What is your best working slogan to motivate yourself, when you don't feel like doing something that must be done?"	"I?õ????m going to share with you a magical word.
Believe me, it really is magical. It helps you create some sort of momentum in your life. But before I reveal the word, I?õ????d like to say something.
The fact that you aren?õ????t where you want to be should be enough motivation.
You could be searching the internet for motivation but keep in mind that other people?õ????s lives are not like yours. When you can?õ????t relate to someone immensely, their words may give you a dopamine boost but that?õ????s the same thing as working your ass off one day and then lying on bed eating chocolate cookies the next two weeks.

If you allow someone else who has no context for your life to give you advice, you?õ????ll drift further and further away from who you are as a unique, authentic individual.
Where you want to be should be something decided by you and you only and it will be the only thing that will serve as the most meaningful motivation in your life. Ever.

What would have happened if Dr. Ambedakar was our Prime Minister?	"Dr. Ambedkar was a genius intellectual and a great man who was way ahead of his time. He was far great than any indian leader according to me.
There is a English proverb ?õ???? Pen is mightier than sword?õ???ù. He showed this in real life. The way he wrote constitution and provided privileges to opressed classes is marvelous. He asked for reservations in jobs and educational institutes for oppressed classes at the time when 99.9% of them were uneducated. Had he been greedy and low IQ person he could have asked for land holdings for them, which would have helped them for only one-two generations. Before 1980s yadavs, jats and gujjars also were against reservation but when these communities came to know that they also can get reservation these communities rather than opposing reservation started asking reservation under OBC category, and now scheduled castes have become so educated that in 2016 an SC girl of 22 years age topped UPSC exam. Now nobody can remove reservation, behind all of this is the mind of Dr Ambedkar. Such was the might of his ?õ????pen?õ???? that now brahmins and rajputs are asking for reservation rather than removing it.
Regarding women, women in India did not have any rights before 1956. If somebody had ever done something substantial for women in India it was ?õ????Dr Ambedkar?õ????. All these women right activists are just gimmicks it was Dr Ambedkar who provided equal rights to women of India. When he provided right to property in ancestral land to women, as law minister, he was severly opposed by higher classes and especially rulers of princely states. He abolished polygamy in hindus, muslims can marry four times but hindus in older days were allowed to keep as many wives as according to his status. Its very sad that women of today don?õ????t know that all these rights which they demand for equality were provided by Dr Ambedkar to them. Now the same people who opposed him are enjoying the rights given to them provided by Dr Ambedkar. Diya kumari princess of jaipur married her employee and her husband lives in the house of diya kumari and diya kumari is the rightful heir to her ancestral property worth thousands of crores, this could not have been possible without Dr Ambedkar.
Had he been Prime Minister he would have ensured equality in our system, would have made India a fair country. India would have been much stronger and would have set up an example for entire world.

"How do you handle someone with radical, conservative views in America?"	"Neither radicalism nor conservatism is an outlook or creed. Rather they are stances or dispositions. Radicalism is the desire to change something. Conservatism instead is the desire to conserve something. In other words, you are never just conservative or radical; you are conservative or radical with respect to something.
In the common understandings of the terms, they are oxymoronic. Conservatism, generally speaking, is the belief that political action can improve our human condition only modestly, while radicals believe that political change is well worth pursuing. However, in world politics, conservatives are thought to favor government while radicals are those liberals or socialists pushing for less state influence.
Things are different here in the US. Our socialists push for more state influence in our lives and our conservatives wish to conserve our liberal heritage of less state power. In fact, libertarianism, which is an outlook, is defined as a political-cum-intellectual movement to revive (which is conservative) and extend (which is radical) liberalism.
There. Libertarians are radical conservatives because they are motivated to seek greater rights and freedoms for individuals. Mainstream conservatives in the US, however, are most often reluctant to go along with extending new rights, particularly when they contravene traditional morality. Is there a sense in which they are radical?
In popular use,
Conservatives may not seek to propel our liberal heritage further leftward like libertarians do, but then, with more than a century now of progressive arrangements and institutions being established here in the US, there is plenty for conservatives to subject to critical questioning. We just saw the vote on a replacement for the ACA in which conservatives clearly stood up for eliminating it entirely, while more statist Establishment Republicans wished only to reform it.
Much of the Blue Model implemented so far by progressives stands not only at odds with our Constitutional guarantees of fully liberal republican government, they are manifestly inferior. And so I handle those radical, conservative views that subject such institutions and arrangements to critical questioning by applauding them.

Having said that, Blogging fraternity is already overcrowded. A great content which is refreshing and unique can surely make you stand out. But unless people know you have a ""great content"" at your blog, it would be a total waste.

As I said, as a Blogger, to stand out of crowd, you must be able to produce nothing less than an awesome content. Not only that, you need to be able to update your blog at least twice a week.

So the answer is that being single is neither rocking nor boring. It?õ????s just the current situation in which you don?õ????t have a boyfriend/girlfriend and you go on with your life like everyone else until you meet someone with whom you?õ????ll maybe after some time start a relationship.

Why is C++ considered a bad language?	"> What are the reasons C++ is considered bad?
Probably easiest to compare C++ with C. C was a beautifully designed language.
The features of the C language were added with purpose. They were intended to solve a real problem and solve that problem they did. Simple arithmetic with promotion. Automatic register allocation with a portable (between compilers) ABI. A simple-but-handy preprocessor. And so on. C is also a lean language: a single person can feasibly write a C compiler in a relatively short time (tinycc is a C99-compliant C compiler written in just 65kLOC of C!). C set out to achieve a clear goal and it achieved its goal. Thanks to the cleanness of C lots of quality compilers came on the market quickly and even decent OSS solutions were available early on.
In contrast, C++ never had a clear goal. The features of C++ were added almost at random. Stroustrup's original idea was essentially ""C is cool and OOP is cool so let's bolt OOP onto C"". Retrospectively, OOP was massively overhyped and is the wrong tool for the job for most of the people most of the time. Half of the GoF design patterns just emulate idioms from functional programming. Real OOP languages like Smalltalk and IO express many useful things that C++ cannot. The feature that C needed most was perhaps parametric polymorphism (aka generics in Java and C#, first seen in ML in the late 1970s) but instead of that C++ got templates that weren't designed to solve any particular problem but rather to kind of solve several completely unrelated problems (e.g. generics and metaprogramming). Someone actually discovered by accident that C++ templates are Turing complete and they wrote and published a program that computed prime numbers at compile time. Wow. A remarkable observation that led to decades of template abuse where people used templates to solve problems much better solved by other pre-existing solutions such Lisp macros and ML polymorphism. Worse, this abuse led to even more language features being piled on top, like template partial specialization.
The massive incidental complexity in C++ made it almost impossible to write a working compiler. For example, it remains extremely difficult to write a parser for the C++ language. The syntax also has horrible aspects like List<Set<int
C++ is said to be fast but the reality is that C++ is essentially only fast when you write C-like code and even then it is only fast for certain kinds of programs. Due to the ""you don't pay for what you don't use"" attitude, C++ is
C++ is so complicated that even world experts make rookie mistakes with it. Herb Sutter works for Microsoft and sits on the C++ standards committee where he influences the future of C++. In a lecture he gave his favorite 10-line C++ program, a thread-safe object cache. Someone pointed out that it leaks memory (
My personal feeling is that the new Rust programming language is what C++ should have been. It has useful known features like generics, discriminated unions and pattern matching and useful new features like memory safety without garbage collection.

The beauty of this definition is that there is no need to bring infinity into the picture (except implicitly).
An infinitesimal unlike epsilon doesn?õ????t need the logical conditional, it just is a positive value that is smaller than any positive real number. However there are no real number infintesimals.

How does the Canadian SWAT team differ from the American SWAT team?	"The above was inspired by Quora User and her response
Answering as a U.S. cop, I?õ????m not sure what sort of differences you would expect, because sound tactics in one place are sound tactics in other places. We learn tactics from other countries all the time, so whatever tactical differences there might be, I?õ????d imagine they are minimal.
I found this online. Source:
Canadian Tactical Teams generally train and are equipped very similarly to their American counterparts and often cross-train with one another in various circumstances. They have the same weapons and deploy the same tactics.
In some parts of Canada, the Province of Ontario for example, part-time teams are not permitted. SWAT or Tactical Teams as they are more commonly referred to, are mandated to be full-time and must train to high standards. For this reason, only cities with larger populations have a full-time team. Smaller agencies may have a containment team but must contract out to a full-time team that can perform hostage rescue and explosive forced-entry missions.
In Ontario, Police Departments are usually larger than in most US states as they use a ?õ????Regional?õ???? Police model, where one Police Department is responsible for policing the entire region or county, for example in the Greater Toronto Area, the population is over 6 million people spread out into 30 cities/towns, there are only 5 Police Departments responsible for the whole area, not including the Provincial Highway Patrol.
Regardless, where a SWAT team is from or their size or status, the one common element is that they are filled with dedicated men and women who fulfill a dangerous mission on a daily basis.
Now there may be different rules of engagement and the rubric used to determine whether to call out the Tactical Team might differ for our neighbors to the north, but the actual operations parts are going to be quite similar.

What is the best supplement for gaining weight?	"I am listing the top selling weight gainers on the market, with a proven track record of helping people achieve their goals. It is not recommend to completely replace your food with weight gainer shake, and always consult a doctor prior using any supplements.
Serious mass is designed to help people gain more weight and muscle mass, particularly those who are aiming for a short schedule in which to gain more mass, and those whose metabolisms are so fast that they need an extra push in gaining mass
True-Mass is a stackable protein supplement that can also double as a meal replacement, depending on usage. It is nutrient- and calorie-dense, and can be used with water or any beverage of choice, though milk is strongly suggested to increase protein and calorie intake further.True-Mass is also considered a perfect intermediate supplement or meal replacement, as a person shifts from beginner to serious or competitive training. Aside from properly regulating and assisting muscle mass gain, it also helps in repair and recovery.
Real Gains operates on the idea of clean calories. This is done with a properly thought-out macronutrient profile that combines high-quality proteins, complex carbohydrates, and essential fatty acids.
This mass building formula features 50 grams of sustained-release protein matrix in one serving of 150 grams, which includes whey protein concentrate, whey protein isolate, milk protein isolate, micellar casein and whey protein hydrolyzed. This powerful combination of fast and slow-digesting proteins creates an anabolic window that lasts for hours and promotes your muscle recovery and growth.
Pro Complex is different from other weight gainers in that it has a higher percentage of calories in the mix. Combine this with complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals, and you have a gainer that offers an ultimate lean gainer solution. It tastes great, too, another advantage for ingestion.

How do quakes occur in earth's crust?	"Earth is composed of 3 layers - crust, mantle and core.
Mantle is in liquid state over which crust is floating like thermocol sheet on water.
The quakes occur due to collision of two crusts or overflow of one crust over another crust. Overflow of crusts leads to other phenomena like formation of mountains - eg: Himalayas. To understand how quakes occur let me explain how mountains are formed.
Before learn how crust is formed and melted simultaneously and slowly. Mantle is composed of several minerals and exist in molten form due to high temperatures. This molten minerals leaks out at few locations and this comes out to the periphery of the earth and cools down to solid rocks - which we call crust. Since this leakage continues with time, the already formed solid surface moves out (in side ward directions) to allow the new material. This process continues and the solid crust forms. The crust formed through this phenomena is called tectonic plates. And all these tectonic plates have boundaries with other plates.
Simultaneously, this crust moves with time instead of being stationary. These movements are also called movement of tectonic plates. For eg, the current Indian subcontinent region is actually a part of Australia. India is a part of Indo-Australian tectonic plates. Several years ago, the part of land separated and move all along to wards China which is a part of Eurasian plate.
Up to now, it is fine.

"Why do I believe that humans can be moral without religion, but struggle to explain why I believe that?"	"There are a number of ethical system that don?õ????t appeal to a god or a religion.
I guess some people assume actions can only be limited by the threat of eternal punishment. The corollary seems to imply if X person sudden suddenly realized there was no god and no punishing hell, they?õ????d rape their sister.
Ask, yourself, why you don?õ????t actually rape your sister. Fear of going to hell? Or, like, you know your sister would not enjoy that. Your actions would make her sad and your whole family sad. You would likely be kicked out of the family. In short, we all act in ways religious people would call ?õ????moral?õ???ù because acting that way just seems like the most reasonable way to stay part of the group, to maximize the happiness of the group, and maximize your own acceptance by the group.
Acting in ways that imply you actually gave a fuck about another human being tends to aid your own survival, by staying part of a group of humans that will share their food with you, will protect you from predators, will notice when you?õ????re sick and help you get better, and will protect you from other warring tribes.
We all have a good sense of how to act moral not because a book written by a bronze aged desert people dictates it to us, but because we all kinda figure it out on our own via some measure of trial and error, logic, and evidence.

After you?õ????ve completed it, you should have a general idea of who your target customers are and how using your product or service would benefit them. You should also have identified who your strategic partners might be and how working with you would benefit them.
Next, create a short summary of your business idea (elevator pitch) with the help of the business canvas model. Set up meetings with the key partners you have identified previously and pitch your idea to them. It would be even better if you have a prototype ready.
Of course, having a good idea and business plan is only the beginning. The key here is to be able to execute your business plan. Everyone has ideas and plans but very few people actually make the effort to execute their plans.

What is the scope of MBA in Entrepreneurship in India? What are the best B Schools for this?	"For the sake of answering this question, I would recommend that you choose one from the following colleges?õ????.only if you can study without taking an Education Loan?õ????
Now, lets be practical - if you are really serious about doing something which others have not been able to do (after all entrepreneurship is mostly about taking the path less taken), you won?õ????t get much help from ANY business school. You have to carve your path on your own even after MBA.
In nutshell, MBA can?õ????t help you much in doing something which other have not done. MBA education is mostly a collection of Best Practices which you should adopt while running a company. And these lessons work well in environments where businesses are already working well.
Now coming to Indian MBA education. Well, the cruel reality is that if you are going to take any education loan, then you will end up looking for a job at the end of your MBA. Colleges safely assume that students will take a Education Loan before joining the institute, and thus they price the courses at a level which no one can afford. And no wonder, after joining such courses people lose their aspirations & creativity and surrender to their immediate need of repaying the loan EMI by getting a regular job.
Worst part - In India MBA is ?õ????considered?õ???? as a career enhancing thing. People don?õ????t do it because they have already excelled in their respective field and hence they need a managerial education to lead a team. Instead, in India, People do MBA because they have had a tough time doing their job (in most cases they were even incapable of doing their job), and hence they want to
And in such circumstances, I doubt if MBA education really means anything in this country. Given your entrepreneurial dreams, I would seriously not recommend it. Rest is upto you.

What are the main complaints ordinary Chinese citizens have about the Hukou system?	"There are quite a few problems with the hukou system.?ˇ First, an explanation for those who may not be familiar with it.
Essentially, a 'hukou' is like a citizenship document, but it designates your citizenship in a specific town/city.?ˇ So if you're born in Chengdu, then you also have a hukou for Chengdu.?ˇ This entitles you to access to all normal services provided by the government in that city -- education, health care, insurance, etc.
The reason for this system is fairly simple -- it is used to prevent large numbers of people from the countryside from moving to the cities, which can cause rapid buildup of slums and significant economic problems (look at Mexico City as an example of what can happen).
The result of this is that if you move to a city where you don't have a hukou, this can cause a lot of problems.?ˇ It means that your children can't go to school there (or that you have to pay for it, rather than getting it for free).?ˇ It can mean restrictions about what kinds of jobs you can get, and access to insurance or other government services.
It is possible, but difficult, to transfer your hukou from one city to another...and it depends on the reason for transferring.?ˇ For example, if you are white-collar worker in a skilled position, who can prove they have a job, transferring the hukou can be easier; but if you're an unskilled laborer, even though jobs in the cities may pay much higher, it may still be extremely difficult or even impossible to get your hukou transferred.
Even worse, under the one-child system, some families had babies that they never reported, never registered, for fear of being punished -- and those children have no hukou whatsoever.?ˇ That means that no matter
So, essentially, it comes down to this.?ˇ If you were born in a major city, have a good education, and a fairly good income, then hukou is not likely going to be much of an issue for you at all.?ˇ But if you were born in the countryside, have minimal education or money, then the hukou system can place significant barriers on your opportunities and decisions.

Is it easier to prove that the infinity exists or that nothing exists?	"Depends on how you define existence. It also depends on which infinity (there's an infinite number).
Let's start with a simple infinity. I draw a circle and imagine someone on the circle walking round. How far can they go before it's impossible to go further? They cc an go round an infinite number of times. Because you can count how many times they'd been round so far, thus is called a countable infinity. Since you can find circles and spheres in the real world, infinity exists in the real world.
Or I can take any two numbers where they aren't equal - no matter how close they are, I can always fit at least nine new numbers between them simply by adding an extra digit after the decimal point. And I can keep doing this as long as I like. Because I can always add new numbers between old ones, this is said to be an uncountable infinity.
An uncountable infinity is infinitely larger than a countable infinity because you can put the whole of the countable infinity down the line of the first new number added. So no matter how small the numbers get, the countable infinity can't cross the gap. It's too small. This kind of infinity might not physically exist, but it mathematically exists.
If the universe is mathematical (in other words, everything we think is real is emergent from the equations of the universe), you'd expect matter to break down at some point, forming things that behave as if physical when they aren't. Spinons and other quasi-particles exhibit this behaviour.
If the universe is simulated, the nature of computation will result in snowballing errors when you try to operate at the limits. Between rounding errors and the impossibility of perfectly computing chaotic effects, any iterative system that is sensitive to initial conditions and approaches Planck units sufficiently to prevent averaging out must show (a) Feigenbaum's Number when cycling, and (b) damaged self-similarity.
Also, if the universe is simulated, clocks of sufficient accuracy to both exhibit and measure quantum uncertainty in time must observe a finite number of possible futures directly (a narrow band of past and future events coexist in the present). No computer can simulate infinite possible futures, but if an infinite number of probability waves are supposed to exist, you should observe every one of those futures before they happen. If the list is finite, or much shorter than a finite expected list, then the universe has to be simulated.
These nothingness experiments could be done with existing technology. The seeing the future one could be done tomorrow, we've good enough clocks. So arguably they're easy problems.
Are they easier than the infinite walk round a circle? In explaining, no. In convincing, because it's counter-intuitive, building a high-resolution clock is going to be far less effort.

What is the most disturbing book you've ever read and why?	"Well, first off, I have bipolar disorder. I've had the pleasure of being in a mental hospital four times in the span of two decades. There were two short stories that intertwined and figured prominently in my delusions EACH time I was hospitalized.
The same two stories every time. I can't shake them. They are not particularly disturbing to most. But they sure grabbed my imagination. Both are now freely available on the web.
The first was ?õ????A Dry, Quiet War?õ???ù. It's science fiction about a veteran coming back home from The Big War. The War at The End of Time. I'm literally getting shudders and chills just thinking about it again.
The next was called ?õ????Learning to be Me?õ???ù. The premise is that in the future, a small device is implanted in your head at birth. It learns to mimic your brain patterns for the next 35 years. So it then matches perfectly. Then the brain is removed and the device takes over running the body. The device is basically immortal.
So one could theoretically still be around for the Big War from the first story. And have time to get very strong.
There's some very interesting ethical questions explored in the second story. Followed by a very interesting plot twist.
Read about my delusions at my personal website if you like. I'd rather not rehash them here. Start at the bottom of the blog and work your way up.
There's one more. This one I was reading as a mental breakdown approached. A friend said if you liked ?õ????Fight Club?õ???ù you'll like this one. I loved ?õ????Fight Club?õ???ù so I started reading his recommendation called ?õ????The Gone-Away World?õ???ù.
It's about the aftermath of some war where a strange weapon was used. One that made most of the world ?õ????go away?õ???ù and vastly altered reality to fill the gap. It's a fairly long book and I don't think I made it through the first 150 pages before I ended up in the hospital once again. It took me over a year to crack it open again. But I did finish it and it hasn't bothered me since then.
Note that all my hospitalizations were due to poor medication management for one reason or another. I'm now very stable since I'm solidly on the right medications.

Do moms hide their period time from kids?	"It sounds like you are ashamed and embarrassed about menstruating?õ???? personally, I am not. I hid it the way you describe when I was in middle school and didn't want people to point anything out, but now as a mother who has given birth twice and become only the more feminist over the years since middle school, I can't imagine being ashamed or embarrassed about my period ever again, certainly not in front of the children that I literally birthed because of said period. I have two boys. One of my greatest hopes is that I raise them with respect for women (and everything they have to go through) and science. Menstruation has a very specific purpose in keeping the world turning (so to speak), many animals just like us experience the same phenomenon, and that's just reality. I want my kids to know reality and have realistic expectations for how women and all humans will fit into this reality. I don't want to pretend to be a Disney princess who has a 19 inch waist, DD cup breasts, and neither farts nor poops. I want them to know their mom as a woman who is human and real and beautiful the way she is. This should set them up well for finding and loving a real woman, not expecting or demanding a Disney princess. You are raising girls: show them pride in womanhood. Teach them about your body which theirs will resemble soon enough. Don't teach them to be ashamed of themselves or their bodies by modeling shame.

What is the best and fastest way to start earning money?	"though i would have loved it if you could read this article on my website, but i believe i should write it here so that others get help too
So the article consists of 3 basic sources of earning:
1.link shortening
2.Ads
3.Affiliate marketing
1.
Link shortening is by far the best and the easiest way to earn money for you do not even need to have a website for earning money using this thing.
Now there are hundreds of link shortening websites available on the internet and I have used them all, one day or the other, so I kind of know their payout rates, and on the basis of that, I have come to a conclusion that
is the best among all.
Their payout rate is just $5 and considering all the factors (country from which the traffic is coming from etc) , you can easily earn not less than $2.5 per 1000 views, which is astonishing because you earn very less( some $0.3 from
).
The interface is very user friendly, plus there are other options for earning money like pop unders as well,
So if you want a link shortening service for your website, you can definitely go for linkshrink.
Sign up for linkshrink from
2.
Getting Adsense approval is a fairly difficult task especially when you are new, let alone the restrictions Google implies on you, So to save myself from all this hassle,
I opted for two different ad servers, with lesser minimum payout, and somewhat equal amount of money as one could get from Adsense
You do not need any traffic at all when it comes to affiliate marketing, even if you could convince someone personally to buy anything, you are good to go.
and
are by far the best affiliations you could possibly go for.
Affiliate marketing is an altogether different approach of earning money online as it focuses on the number of sales generated through your website, not the amount of clicks, so consider someone buying an Ipod from your blog or website and the commission is 4%,say,
So you straightaway earn $4 if it is of $100, easy enough right?
So these are the top 3 techniques by which you could kickstart your earnings from the get go.

What interview officer can ask me if my hobbies are computer gaming and social networking in an SSB interview?	"Then get ready he surely going to ask questions on the games you play , as most of time we think io doesn't know about computer games and social networking but it actually he is a mini wikipedia, don't expect to make a fool of him by thinking that he may not know . Get ready with reasons why you like the game ,which other games you like ,type of games you like and do play games based on military ex battlefield series .
1 ) I will give you an example which happened with one of my friend during ssb
He played San Andreas , io asked him details about the games then he asked whether he played games such as battlefield, igi ,?õ???? for some moment my friend was shocked , then he said he played , but liked GTA more.
Io: so I see you are bent on criminal games and not interested on games based on military?õ????.
This shows that you are ready to don, not a gentleman .
Here you should not break your ground what ever he says be firm and confident on the point till the last until he stops the discussion .
In that another friend had the same interest after hearing that he in the interview said that he loved to play battlefield . He actually streotyped and knew nothing about this game and he got grilled .
Here also vice versa happen that io may ask you are completely stereotyped ( not able to make friends ) to play computer games and not interested to make friends outside and play games with them . Give him a good reason which you only know , Be honest about it . Always be firm and confident and never lose ground .
Social networking--
Mostly he may ask you questions about history of the site , various facility available and anything if you would have been the CEO get the item removed. What you like the most and what you hate the most .. These are some if the io is bold he ask whether you stalk girls on Facebook that category may continue . He may also ask whether wasting time on Facebook not doing anything useful .These all may also pop up . be ready with the answers ..
I better suggest you if have doubt in above questions about answers I may give some suitable answers but your own answer portrays your originality and image ..
Please do write back if you need any other help ..
All the best

Life Advice: How can I learn to love myself?	"The magical ingredient that causes self-love is a healthy self-worth. How you look at yourself defines your dynamics with others.
Self-love doesn't come from waking up and saying I love you to the mirror. It takes understanding, time and effort, but it is not impossible. All we need is to pause and see where we lack in self-worth, and work on those areas.
You know all your flaws and insecurities. How do you get over them?
In my attempt to write about this deep concept, I will discuss three scenarios which will give you a simplistic idea of how we can restore self-love in our life by ?õ????
On their first date, she tells him ?õ????You are dark and ugly and I don?õ????t want to meet you again.?õ???ù He feels ?õ????I am dark and ugly nobody will ever love me :(?õ???? His lack of self-love makes him jittery about himself; he doubts his likability by anyone else. He forgets all those people who liked and appreciated him and just focuses on that one person who didn?õ????t like him.
In such situation?õ????
Self-love restored.
Guy comes back to the reality and responds ?õ???ùOkay, may be, you think so. I shall see someone who finds me wonderful. "" and moves on.
If he would have surrendered in front of his insecurities, he would have made ?õ????I look ugly?õ???ù his reality. But he paused and cleared the nonsense and took a wise decision.
In this story, this guy wanted to be a body builder. His well-wisher friend, who didn?õ????t see bodybuilding as a great career, told him, ""this is not a great career choice for you. You should focus on getting a job."" With low self-love, Mr Builder decided that he will never speak to him after that day. His insecurity of people doubting his capacity creped in, and a good friendship was about to end.
In such situation?õ????
Self-love restored, ?õ????My friend may be you think that way and that?õ????s okay. I know what I am doing. Anyway, let?õ????s go and grab a coffee.?õ???ù
Low self-love builder was insecure about people respecting his profession. Builder has this void of appreciation and respect. Before transformation he was depending on others for validation, appreciation and respect. He paused and realized, problem was within. Builder had a happy realization, and his outlook changed.
There are times when nothing goes well in life, this guy invested in stock market and it collapsed, he fails to pay his home loan bills, his wife leaves in the soup and files for divorce. ?õ????I don?õ????t want to live such a life, It?õ????s all over.?õ???ù
In such situation?õ????
Pause. Take a moment to think:?õ???ù My life was not always like this, I have seen ups> downs> and again ups, this is just a phase, I am facing insecurity >pain> rejection all at once, yes it is overwhelming and yes it will pass by.?õ???ù
All of us have a lot of potential, the problem is, it gets buried under unnecessary worries, and nonsense that we tell ourselves.
Think of the moments when you felt loved, happy, confident and proud of yourself. List those things on a piece of paper.
Now, close your eyes and get back to those moments. Think of those good moments, when you were a winner, may be when you won that trophy or got that compliment.
We are born as happy human being, as the life goes on we move on from inner goodness to darker places.
Give this exercise a try and meet people with a positive energy, if you hit those down moments then pause and detoxify your mind, re-store your self-love.

Why is it so hard for me to find what I love?	"This is tough. I feel similar. It is either I feel I am not passionate or I feel that I am not capable of being great in a field. I would say that you may never love something, but you may be the best in something that isn?õ????t really that interesting to you.
How does that sound. Everyone give you praise in a thing, but you have no passion in it. I think that you can still find an existence without passion. What you are doing is great. You are trying different things. You are not limiting yourself to one thing that you will specialize in for the rest of your life, not knowing much else.
Try reading about some of the great minds of the past. Many of them had many interests. Yes, they had careers, that one thing they went to school for, or apprenticed after, however, many also had hobbies. Some of these hobbies later eclipsed even their careers.

I own a small company and I had an employee miss his flight for a business trip. Who should be responsible for the cost to re-book the flight?	"One of the things you get to do in a small company that gives you an advantage over a larger company is that you can make decisions like this on an individual basis. Your goal, however, should be to treat everyone fairly.
If it were me, I?õ????d start with the assumption that the employee was acting in good faith unless and until it was clearly established otherwise. That means that I?õ????d have the company pay any extra cost.
Obviously if this sort of thing happened regularly, I might feel obliged to make a decision less favorable to the employee.
Another poster has suggested that the way to resolve this is by having created, in advance, a comprehensive travel policy that covered all eventualities. This is another one of those things that is a good idea but rarely happens in a small company, which by necessity has to focus its limited time and resources on more important issues.
The company I ran, Catapult Communications, functioned pretty darn well for more than 20 years, including 10 years as a public company, without ever having a comprehensive employee handbook. My philosophy was, and contin8es to be, that taking great care in the hiring process pretty much eliminates the need for a rule-bound environment.

Is Denmark an English speaking country?	"No it?õ????s not, prepare for the worse.
I have been here for a few months now, and although people speak English fluently, this is not enough. Here?õ????s why:
1- Governmental services barely offered in English, imagine working and having to review your taxes or other related staff or even visit your GP, most of the services are offered only in Danish.
2- Shops, restaurant menus, market products, mobile carrier support, ads and all these staff are only in Danish, imagine having to call customer support or checking your voice mail and the response comes only in Danish. Or imagine you are buying something from the supermarket that you need to know its ingredients, this comes only in Danish (may be also Swedish and Finnish sometimes)
3- Danes love to speak Danish, if you are a group of 10 people from different countries, 2 Danes will communicate together in Danish no matter what others might think about that, I have seen this quite a lot.
So if you are planning for a short visit to Denmark, prepare your smartphone with a Danish Dictionary, download the Danish language to Google Translate app to use it on the go.
If you are planning to live in Denmark, make sure your plan includes learning the language because you may struggle in more situations.

How do people who don't believe in creationism nor evolution explain how we came to be?	"First, evolution is a theory that explains the diversity of life on earth we see today. It posits the diversity we see today came from a common ancestor by a process of descent with modification. The evidence backing evolution is vast. Multiple lines of evidence from diverse fields that have nothing to do with each other all converge on the same conclusion: the diversity of life on earth is explained by descent with modification from a common ancestor.
Evolution is NOT, however, a theory that explains the origin of life. That?õ????s not to say there are not many good hypotheses being tested. But, as of yet, no one has a well tested theory of the origin of life on par with the well tested theory of evolution.
Creationism is, likewise, not a well tested explanation. It?õ????s a story that people are happy to simply accept and not subject to scientific testing.
Some people think that if evolution can?õ????t explain something then creationism wins by default. Alas, the origin of life or the origin of species is not a locked room mystery. That is to say, three people are in a locked room. One of them was murdered with a gun. There?õ????s a smoking gun on the floor. There?õ????s no way another person could have gotten into the room. Either Person A or Person B killed Person C with the gun. Person B refuses to have his hands tested for gun powered burns. Person A volunteers. We find Person A has no gun powered burns, indicating Person A did not pull the trigger. We can safely conclude if we?õ????ve eliminated Person A, then the only option left is Person B.
However, natural science is not neat. You can?õ????t conclude ?õ????if not A then B.?õ???ù
There was a time when we thought the best explanation for lighting was god. Imagine two hypotheses: lightning is caused by god or lighting is caused by natural gas dripping from the clouds in a spout fashion and then catching on fire. We test for the presence of natural gas. We find none. However, it?õ????s clear that?õ????s not then evidence for a god. It?õ????s clear our two camps were simply ignorant of electricity. There was another, better explanation we just didn?õ????t have the knowledge and technology to understand.
So, if it?õ????s not clear that ?õ????if not evolution then creationism?õ???ù is a false dichotomy then understand the courts have also concluded this as well. McLean V Arkansas well established if evidence fails to support evolution then creationism does not win by default. It?õ????s a contrived dualism.
But let?õ????s roll this back a bit further. Wut? Are there people that reject both creationism (life was created or started by a god of some sort) and evolution? I?õ????ve not encountered such people.

Do you believe animals have consciences?	"According to the Qur?õ????an, every thing including animals are worshiping the Creator, worshiping is a event that happens intentionally and is a sign that shows animals have a degree of conscience:
The seven heavens glorify Him, and the earth [too], and whoever is in them. There is not a thing but celebrates His praise, but you do not understand their glorification. Indeed, He is all-forbearing, all-forgiving. [17:44]
Because of this reality sometimes men that misuse or neglect the faculties fall in the position less than animals:
Certainly We have winnowed out for hell many of the jinn and humans: they have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, they have ears with which they do not hear. They are like cattle; indeed, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless. [7:179]

How can I increase my speed in badminton?	"Speed and power is very important in the game of badminton.Increasing your speed depends on the footwork. A Component of the footwork is the foot speed.
Faster the foot speed , time it takes to land and push off of the court is very quick. To improve the foot speed is to increase the reaction time it takes between the landing and the push off.
The focus here is to activate the muscles with a focus on the front three quarters of the foot.We should have our gravity constantly on the forward seventy-five percent of our foot than back on our heels.Because when we are back on our heels it is more difficult to get that quick movement off of the ground. So when we want to move in whichever direction on the court it is necessary to keep the gravity accessible on the forward for faster movements.
Open your legs wider at all times. In other words, you stay lower to the ground. As you do this, you improve your balance.
This requires a certain level of fitness. You need strong legs to stay low to the ground.
Staying low does NOT mean bending your body towards the ground.
It means widening your legs, but your body must remain straight and firm. Your back must be straight! NOT hunching towards the ground.

Now Satan, he certainly gets caught off guard by things. But that?õ????s because he contends with God, who?õ????s always going to have more up his sleeve than you think.

What is your preferred CMS and why?	"Wordpress,
I prefer wordpress, when it is used with trusted themes and plugins. The reason is:

Will I ever be able to make money? My date of birth is 03.03.1971 at 12.05pm at Delhi.	"Dear Sanjeev,
Without much details into your profession and your past earning sources, there is not much i can assume. However, I have a serious advice for you:
It doesn?õ????t matter at all what is our age. All it matters is how optimistic we are. I can really put into your shoes and can understand the issue as i too going through the same scenario. But the only difference is, i am positive and will remain positive until i get back to my previous earning path as currently i have no job and purely earning through freelancer platforms.
You can meanwhile, look into those ways where you are good at. Understand your strength and weakness. Weigh yourself on what you can do and what not. Try to give it a shot. Also please note: Never give you yourself. I know the day is not ours. But please note that everyday will not be the same.
At this time, you need to push real hard to get some sort of earning sources as per your capabilities.
Basis your date of birth and time and place, Since past one year or so you are facing financial troubles which i am able to see and understand. Meanwhile, There are relief signs in your birth chart this year which you would find relaxed post June.
Please note that the reason i am sending your predictions is to ensure that you go through them and plan for betterment accordingly in case of any predictions which may impact your life. Also please note that i am not a Astrologer and i have no grip on Astrology. My father was a great Astrologer and his friend has given me this software and this has helped me take precautions of any predictions which had bad effect in my chart. For me this astrology proved to be correct and not necessarily mean that it may be correct for you too.
All the Best.

"If I stub my toe, does God feel it?"	"Whenever I watch shows/videos that feature people making mistakes, such as wiping out on skateboards or bicycles, I literally feel an uncomfortable, electric twinge at the moment of impact. Since I know what it?õ????s like to feel one?õ????s skin scraping against cement or asphalt, the memory must provoke this physical sensation.
If you believe in God and you know what I mean with regard to the example above, I would say, yes, God probably does feel our pain in some way.

"How can I turn $5000 into $100,000?"	"It depends on your risk tolerance.
If you are willing to lose everything in order to gain high payout, go to a casino. You will either hit your target or lose everything in no time (pray before you go).
If you have low tolerance of risks, invest in a diversified portfolio that consist index funds (domestic stocks, foreign developed stocks, foreign emerging stocks, etc.), bonds, real estates, small business(es), etc. According to Nobel-winner Harry Markowitz, diversification is free lunch. However, you may need to wait for decades to achieve your $100,000 goal, but for sure, you will not lose your money.
If you have high risk tolerance, keep your $5,000 in bank, then passionately and patiently hunt for one (or two) once-in-a-lifetime investment bargain. Nobody can tell you what is it (or when/where/how), but you just need to keep digging. When you finally find one, be sure to put every dime into that opportunity. Charlie Munger recently said that he read the Barron?õ????s for 50 years and finally found that one great idea. He bought that stock at $1 and he sold it at $15 in 2 years time (The stock went on to $40), then he invested the money with a brilliant fund manager who returned 5 times in few years. Only one or two ideas are what it counts, but don't expect such ideas to come knocking your door everyday. Remember, this path is not for everyone, it takes a character to achieve success via this approach.

Will he come back if I take time away?	"He probably won?õ????t come back. He might, but he really shouldn?õ????t.
You see, taking time apart from each other won?õ????t fix what was wrong with your relationship. If you two were incompatible, if he was unhappy, if you had trust issues, then being apart won?õ????t fix any of those things. One or both of you will need to go through a big change in order for you two to be at a point where you can be happy together.
Also, if he?õ????s been unhappy for a long time, or if he?õ????s been working up toward the breakup for a while, that implies that he?õ????s put a lot of thought into whether or not he should break up with you. That would imply that he?õ????s probably not going to come back, especially if he specifically told you that he wasn?õ????t coming back.

Is society unique to human beings only?	"How can we say that?
We are only aware about our society hence we seem to think the society is unique to human beings. The ants have their own unique existence as do the bees. All the animals and plants have their own world created around them.
The sad part is that in today?õ????s world we seem to have lost that connect with nature and hence we have the audacity to think that the only thing which is existent in the world is humans or that only humans have societies.
Sure we are the only beings on Earth capable of thinking and building and adapting to a great level but that does not mean that others do not exist. Every living being is a part of it?õ????s own unique environment with it?õ????s own set of rules. We just do not know it.
Animals live in packs and herds which suggests they certainly have their own way of communicating or a basic understanding of groups. I am no expert on this matter but would refrain from saying a society is unique to humans only.

Can I make a living working at a warehouse?	"That depends on how you define a living and where you live. I?õ????ve worked around a lot of warehouses and in many too. I personally could not make a living doing it.
I?õ????ve worked inside warehouses in Kentucky (in attached studios) where many of the entry level workers could make a living if all you wanted was a cheap car and live in an old run down house, maybe share a place or live at home. However, stay on the job and move into even the first line of supervisors and many of those people had apartments and small homes of their own. Many who have hung around for 2?õ????4 years can own a nice home in many places, not just KY or IN.
Look at states with low cost of living and who have large warehouse districts and you can often make a living and have a decent life if you move into even the lowest levels of leadership. NV, KY, IN, OK, MO, AL, TN, and others all have lots of warehouse and distribution centers where you can make a living.
Expensive states like CA, NY and others are very difficult. If you live in your Mom?õ????s basement and have no bills you can do it.

"Why do people obey god? I personally believe that he's real, but I don't want to obey him. I mean, why do I have to do it? Because he created life?"	"There are two points to say:
From the Islamic viewpoint, the humans are free to obey God or not, there is no any force or coercion to make our decision to obey God or not, but whatever we decide about this matter we are responsible for its consequences. God has created the humans and he is the best guide for our salvation.
Imagine a person that just invented a new machine, for example a man that made a new kind of car. He knows how to use it, where can or can`t we use it, how to repair it, etc. He is the best person who knows everything about this car and if we ask any question about this car, he knows the answer. Now, we believe that God created us and He is the best knower of everything about us; our abilities, our powers, our goals, our capacities, our talents, etc.
He is the most compassionate and the most merciful and He wants salvation for us, so we are sure that He is the most trustable in this way, so if we want our salvation we should obey Him. In fact, we obey Him because we are sure that He wants the best for us. And we trust Him and His orders just like when we trust to our teacher to teach us how to read and write.

Why do people commit crimes that they will obviously get caught?	"My answer is not articulate as the rest. My answer to the question, ?õ????Why do people commit crimes that they will obviously get caught??õ???ù It?õ????s because they want to. For one reason or another people sometimes commit crimes TO GET CAUGHT.
One example that I can offer is a group of truckers I knew would work like crazy, live a good life for eight months and then commit a not so serious crime where they would be sentenced for 90 days or so because they would be assured of getting ?õ????three hots and a cot?õ???ù. It?õ????s better than living under a bridge or standing in line at the shelter. in the cold harsh winter.
There are other people that commit a crime because when the weigh the repercussions and consider their actions are worth it. For example, someone calls you a derogatory name and you punch them. The chances are your going to get arrested and maybe going to jail because in this society you can?õ????t put your hands on someone else. But, to some, there is an immediate satisfaction when someone does you wrong and you retaliate even though you know you?õ????ll be going to jail.

There are numerous jobs in pharmaceutical and diagnostic research on genetics, ranging from discovering new targets for drugs, identifying new drugs from natural sources, identifying genetic variation in drug responses, plant breeding and many other aspects of genetics which are fascinating and can pay well.

When did human societies first begin to debate about the best way to govern?	"A conversation in East Africa, c. 100,000 years ago:
H.S. 1: ?õ????Yeah, look, I think the chieftain?õ????s a nice enough guy, but I hate how he clubs people who disagree with how much food he gets to eat after the hunt. We all hunt, so we should all get equal shares!?õ???ù
H.S. 2: ?õ????We don't all hunt equally, though. Some are better than others, and the chieftain?õ????s hunting parties always bring home the biggest gazelles. Why shouldn't he get the most??õ???ù
H.S. 3: ?õ????I just wish he would stop antagonising the tribe beyond the hills. There's no reason we can't be friends.?õ???ù
H.S. 2: ?õ????Yeah?õ???? Anyway, why should you get to decide what's fair and isn?õ????t??õ???ù
H.S. 1: ?õ????Why should he?!?õ???ù
H.S. 4: ?õ????Why do the hunters get to run the tribe in the first place? We gatherers contribute just as much.?õ???ù
H.S. 3: ?õ????They're way more equal in the tribe beyond the hills?õ?????õ???ù
H.S. 1: ?õ????If you like them so much, go live over there!?õ???ù
That?õ????s a stretch, of course, as current evidence suggests that hierarchies are more closely associated with agricultural societies than hunter-gatherer ones (so maybe that was a conversation in Mesopotamia c. 8,000 years ago?õ????), but with any sufficiently large and complex society at any period of time you would almost certainly find conversations about how the society ought to organize and behave.
It just wasn?õ????t until humanity had the time and comfort to be able to sit down and develop writing that we could have examples of those conversations to inform the further development of civilization and government.

Would gay men pick up that I was straight if I were in a gay bar?	"For a straight dude, I've spent rather a lot of time in gay bars, as I have friends of a wide array of sexual orientations and identities (and gay bars often host the best fetish parties).
What I have found is that gay people are not monolithic. Some people pick up on the fact that I'm straight; some people don't. Different people, even people who are gay, have different levels of perception, different social skills, different abilities to read body language...gay or straight or bi or pan or ace, people are people, you know?
Sometimes I get approached when I'm at a gay bar, sometimes I don't. Same as when I'm not at a gay bar. If I'm approached by another man, I've always found that ""sorry, I'm straight"" works well. To be honest, gay dudes seem a lot better than straight dudes in that regard.

What should I know before going skydiving for the first time?	"It depends, but I would recommend that you select a United States Parachute Association (USPA) dropzone (DZ) if you are making a tandem skydive, accelerated freefall (AFF), or static-line jump (SL). USPA dropzones are located globally, the reason I recommend an affiliated DZ is that they must meet certain standards and conduct to keep their affiliation. If you cannot locate a USPA DZ in your area, I would look for one that is affiliated with that country?õ????s national parachuting association, the standards are likely to be relative to a USPA dropzone. This is also important if you decide to continue past your first skydive and become a licensed skydiver.
Most of skydiving is mental, physical speaking someone of average fitness can perform as well as an athletic person. Yes, you first skydive is going to be full of adrenaline, you mind is going to try and talk you out of doing it. My first couple dozen jumps I didn?õ????t even like looking out the door to spot the airport, it?õ????s weird to be that high up in the air and look down at something without a window separating you from the ?õ????danger?õ???ù.

Last thing, don?õ????t listen to anyone except a skydiver, there?õ????s a lot of bullshiters or people that did one tandem jump ten years ago that think they know, but they don?õ????t. It best to call or visit a DZ if you have questions or reservations about doing this. Going to a DZ is fun and a relaxed environment, there will be many people available to talk your ear off about the sport.

To understand that answer, you have to consider the question to be defective ?õ???? that is, the whole notion that the meaning of life is some sort of objective truth which is detectable in the same way that rocks and water are hard and wet ?õ???? that notion is defective.

When the human mind interprets reality in this self-vs-Other way, there are certain consequences, and one of them is a loss of meaning and unity.
In short, because of the way your mind chops reality up into different concepts, you experience life and yourself as a bunch of objects sort of loosely inter-related. That way of experiencing life tends to suck all the meaning out of it, because it prevents you from experiencing true self.
True self understands the meaning of life because true self IS the meaning of life ?õ???? to be that is to be yourself, to be yourself is to be meaningful. There?õ????s just no way to render that kind of truth in the object-oriented logical manner that people use when they?õ????re looking for the meaning of life as some sort of invariant truth ?õ????out there?õ???ù like stars or rocks or water.

"If a car had unlimited power but was able to stay grounded, would there be a limit to the speed at which the actual wheels could rotate?"	"Thanks for the A2A
I?õ????m?õ????. gonna say yes.
What I can?õ????t say is exactly what that limit would be.
The thing about wheels is that they all have different tolerances.
But let?õ????s start at the beginning.
For starters, if an engine with unlimited power were to also have unlimited torque, it would probably shatter the wheels right off the get-go. For that matter, the other components between them could likely break beforehand. Drag cars often snap driveshafts or shear off lugs because of the massive amount of torque they exert.
(why yes, that is a Celica. You guys should have known.)
Anyway, let?õ????s assume there are no mechanical limits exceeded before the wheel. And the car begins at a roll and just steadily gets infinitely faster and faster. Also assuming infinite road, you?õ????d wind up wearing and/or blowing the tire pretty quickly. And I?õ????m gonna assume you know what happens there.
Okay, assuming again, the tire can withstand the pressures, but the wheel cannot. What goes first? Well?õ???? I?õ????m not sure. My guess would be that the forces acting on the hub part of the wheel would wind up literally snapping it off, because it couldn?õ????t physically keep up due to friction, or that same friction would heat it up and melt or warp it.
Okay, let?õ????s take one element out of the equation. The wheel is free-spinning, in a vacuum. So, for intents and purposes, it?õ????s frictionless. (We?õ????ve already assumed the wheel bearing is indestructible so bear with me).
Well then, your limit would probably be inertia. The faster and faster you spin the wheel, the more and more it would want to start warping and stretching. Eventually, the wheel would probably just come apart due to those forces.
From a practical standpoint, though, tires are a much bigger problem than the wheels themselves. The Bugatti Veyron for instance has tires that are glued to the wheels, and can?õ????t maintain top speed for very long, because they?õ????ll heat up and blow.
It?õ????s a Ferrari but you get the point. It?õ????s bad.
If the wheel, tire, and other mechanical components were indestructible?õ????
Then I guess no, it would have no limit.
But that?õ????s kind of boring, isn?õ????t it?

"What's your favourite ever football (soccer) moment, and why?"	"Nobody could have written a better and a more nerve-wracking script to a PL conclusion than what we saw on that day. For the uninitiated, Manchester United and Manchester City were locked as the only 2 teams for a PL win until the last match of the season.
The math was simple. Even if both Manchester City and United won their respective games, City would go on to lift the trophy due to a better goal difference. Both the teams were playing on the same day, albeit at different places, looking to script their name in history.
However, all seemed to have been lost for City as they headed into injury time trailing 2?õ????1 to QPR (the team with the worst away record) at Etihad Stadium whereas United was winning its game by a margin of 1?õ????0 against Sunderland.
But when it comes to football, miracles do happen. Tears do fall, time does stop for a while and players do rise to the occasion and overwhelm everybody.
What happened on that day in that injury time has been forged in history as ?õ????o
5 minutes of injury time had been added.
The disbelief was about to begin.
The fans had started to believe again. Could the unbelievable happen?
The game was tied but City did not need a tie as the game at United?õ????s end had drawn to a close and the red devils had started celebrating.
And then this happened in the

The ball had been passed on to him just outside of the 30 yards circle. Aguero dribbled against 2 defenders and with a clean flick of his leg, he guided the ball into the goalpost.
The rooftop of Etihad Stadium exploded that day. And the thunderous roar could be heard all the way to Old Trafford.
The crowd went into a frenzy. The commentators lost their voice after witnessing what happened on the pitch. Tears started rolling down the eyes of the City?õ????s faithful as Aguero ripped open his shirt and ran like a man possessed.
Manchester City had done it. The wait of 44 years had finally come to an end.
People had invaded the pitch as everybody lost sense of time and place. The footballing world gasped in utter disbelief. Roberto Mancini (City?õ????s then manager) bear-hugged everybody off the pitch as he couldn?õ????t believe what he had seen.
Manchester became blue that day.
Man United players along with Sir Alex Ferguson, on the other hand, were stunned into silence as the news was broken that a miracle had erupted at Etihad Stadium. That Man City had snatched a victory and more importantly the EPL crown in literally the dying stages of the season.
I am an FC Barcelona fan but the goosebumps I witnessed on that day were so intensified that they resembled pockmarks on my skin.

How do you track a USPS international package?	"Global Express Guaranteed (GXG), Priority Mail Express International (PMEI), and Priority Mail International (PMI) can be tracked by typing your customs declaration number into USPS tracking lookup. The number can be found on your receipt. PMEI numbers start with E and end with US. PMI numbers start with C and end with US. GXG numbers are 10 digits without any letters.
First Class Package International Service (FCPIS) can currently be tracked if it was paid for via USPS Click-n-Ship or another online service. These tracking numbers start with L or H and end with US. FCPIS packages with tracking number starting with U cannot be tracked. FCPIS packages purchased at retail locations should be trackable in early 2018.
PMEI, PMI, and FCPIS are scans domestically through all points. The frequency and timeliness of the international scans depends on the destination country.
GXG is scanned throughout its travel.

Our thoughts have mass. Is this true?	"Friends
Yes.
Thoughts have mass.
Let's share:
Forms of physical energy like water,electricity,sound etc.,forms of psychic energy like thoughts,emotions and forms of conscious energy like consciousness-sensing our own presence/existence,sensing presence of surroundings etc.are only identifiable and quantifiable by there respective sets of laws and tools/means and we categorise things as physical world,psychic world & conscious world.
These sets of laws & tools/means are incomensurable with each other and they can't be substituted with each other.
Thoughts have mass,weight,shape,color,lifespan,affinities,intrinsic activities,densities,architecture-arrangement of its fundamental units-trave history,interaction between thoughts,fading etc.but none of these features can neither be identified nor be quantified by physical senses.
They only can be conceptualized by mind and verified indirectly by assessing their impacts on physical world-our body.

Why does Modi spread Hinduism?	"If Modi is spreading Hinduism only then the question ?õ????Why does Modi spread Hinduism?õ???ù is valid.
Now let's come to the main point. Many think Modi is spreading Hinduism because he goes to temple and not mosque. He celebrates Diwali but not ramzaan. He puts Tika on forehead but he does not wear round white skull-cap.
A PM who is hindu should not practice his religion?
In order to prove he is secular, he should celebrate all festivals?
To prove he is secular he should dress like Muslim, Hindu, Christian and Sikh? This will look like national fancy dress.
Main problem is people are happy with a minister who wears white round cap and make minority happy. Don't they need development?
And if Modi follows his religion and works hard for development, people say he is not secular.
So decide who you want. A PM who does religious fancy dress or the one who wants to bring development.

Is the reason that the only mammals with beaks are monotremes because these are the only mammals that don't need to latch onto a nipple as babies?	"I don?õ????t think the beaks of monotremes have anything to do with mammalian evolution from reptiles; there?õ????s no great similarity to reptilian jaws. I think they?õ????re more an adaptation to the animal?õ????s feeding habits?õ????the platypus bill, loaded with electroreceptors, for probing into stream gravel and sediments for crustaceans and other prey, and the echidnas for probing into ant and termite mounds. The platypus bill is unique, but the echidna beak doesn?õ????t strike me as much different from the ?õ????beak?õ???ù of an anteater.
Here is an echidna skeleton, top, and an anteater skeleton, below it. Do you see much cranial difference other than size? I don?õ????t. So can?õ????t we say that an anteater, a eutherian mammal with a diet much like an echidna?õ????s, also has a beak? (A good case of convergent evolution.) Someone else has already pointed out that dolphins do as well. And consider these opening lines of the Wikipedia article, ?õ????Beaked Whales?õ???ù: ?õ????Beaked whales are the members of the family Ziphiidae, which consists of 22 species. These toothed whales are notable for their elongated beaks.?õ???ù
Yet anteaters, dolphins, and beaked whales still suck milk from a mother?õ????s nipples.
So in the bottom line, I think the premise of the question is mistaken?õ????monotremes are far from being ?õ????the only mammals with beaks.?õ???ù

What is your earliest childhood memory?	"When I rack my brains hard enough, the following incident comes to my mind. Must have taken place when I was three.
Scene : School has just ended and all the kids are waiting for their parents to take them home. I pick a fight with a fellow pig-tailed preschooler. I must have hit her real hard. I don't exactly recall this piece of incriminating evidence, but all I do remember is that she was bawling real loud.
Enter Older Girl (probably 5 or 6 years old at that time).
This went on for a good few minutes before Older Girl got tired, took the still bawling pig-tailed preschooler by the hand and led her away from me.
I went home and narrated the incident to Mom, asking the same query. She scolded me for getting into fights, but told me that even
Only when Dad talked to me later that night and explained a few rules of grammar (and etiquette, but I'd rather leave that out), did I realize not everything followed logic; not everything was simple as it seemed.
And that, my friends, was the day I realized ""English is a very funny language"".

"What are the best aspects of living in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, UK as a young adult?"	"Although, my ?õ????by-line?õ???? says I?õ????ve lived in Nottingham from 2009, I was actually born in Nottingham (a place called Bulwell, back in 1967); grew up here and only moved away to work in London between 2000 & 2005, but I?õ????ve been back for 12 years.
As some of the other Quorans have mentioned, Nottingham pretty much has it all. Night life; day life; entertainment; sport (for fun and the more serious kinds); beautiful surrounding countryside, and history going back to something like the 11th or 12th century. Some of the many attractions include Nottingham Castle (
We also have excellent city centre shopping facilities - some nearby cities have their shops scattered all over the place with quite a bit of walking to do between shops, but ours are all together. There are two large malls - one near the train station called Broadmarsh (
As for living here, Nottingham has a house or flat to suit everybody, at a budget to suit all pockets. There a number of suburbs and outlying areas, all easily accessible by road, tram or bus and one of them will be right for you. Of course there are some areas that are more affluent than others, but there is nowhere that you would call a dangerous part of town. Even the couple of areas that made the news for gun/gang crime over the past ten years are actually not bad places and the crime rate is generally pretty low across the board. Good people and bad - like any other city - but I like to think mostly good.
Nottingham now is very different from when I was a young adult, but I think in a lot of ways it has improved - better schools & universities (two in Nottingham with Loughborough, Leicester & Derby universities only a short distance away); good employment opportunities and plenty to do and plenty to see.

"Is SNL overstepping its boundaries regarding this administration? When I watch it, it makes me feel like President Trump is not fit."	"A Saturday Night Live skit makes you think President Trump is not presidential material? REALLY? Wow ?õ???? you should tune into the news once in awhile. SNL?õ????s skits focus on one or two aspects of Trump?õ????s behavior or mannerisms, and blows them all out of proportion in order to amplify their silliness, or their reflection of his lack of maturity, his bent toward bullying behavior, or his grandiosity. If it takes SNL to make you aware of those things, then, I?õ????m sorry, but you have simply not been paying attention. SNL?õ????s skits are effective and comedic because they take a real-life trait or personality quirk and inflate it to preposterous dimensions. With Mr. Trump, they have so many options to choose from, and the target is so ?õ????yuuuge?õ???ù that it probably isn?õ????t all that hard. I?õ????ll bet an SNL writer would tell you that those skits virtually write themselves. How many times did you see President Obama roasted on SNL? Not very often, correct? That is because he was a man of maturity, class, grace and intelligence ?õ???? usually not very funny things, although they are admirable. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, is brim full of false bravado, strange turns of phrase, bellicosity and general pompousness ?õ???? the perfect targets for a comedian. Trump has created a ?õ????golden age?õ???ù for SNL (and man, did they ever need it). But please don?õ????t make judgements about a politician?õ????s qualities based on what you see on late-night comedy television shows. Watch the news instead. Although the journalists are, at times, as goofy as the comedians on SNL, the stories they are telling are (for the most part) true.

What are quick (legal) ways to earn cash?	"Depends largely on the definition of quick. If you have marketable skills you can quickly pickup freelance jobs in IT, Design, Finance or Marketing to make extra few hundred.
Much better return for your skills you can get by building courses to places like Udemy.
If you have capital and skills in statistics you can try to learn financial markets and make money trading. Having some experience on this I would say. Days of discretionary(trading by gut feeling) traders are mostly gone. Nowadays you need to apply strong math and computer science skills to make consistent profit.
Also realistically you should not expect more than 10?õ????20%(if good at this) return on average. Sure there are good times, but there are some pretty bad once as well and sometimes you cannot fully hedge against them. This means you need at least 500K$ for decent returs or risk tolerance and conficence to leverage small account many times over.
In the age of internet building anything truly viral (million of eyeballs) is usually easy to monetise for a nice pile of money. If you are lucky, funny or creative, this can happen fast.
You can also build your own company. This one is not quick but can rake the largest rewards.

How can we develop a true passion for research among the youths of India?	"This is a very good question. Youth can be attracting not just by attracting potential researchers but also by enhancing the experience and career of existing researchers. Here are some some suggestions considering both the above:
I would also suggest the scholarship and/or stipends to the researchers to be significantly more than the current amount. But, given that (i) Scholarship/stipends in western countries are similar when compared against the salary of a fresh graduate (ii) they get subsidized food and accommodation, I would not place them under India specific reasons. Although in entirety, significant increase in the scholarship can go a long way towards attracting youths.

What is it like to work at united india insurance company india?	"I completed one full year of my job in United India Insurance Company Limited last month. I am posted in a metro city and I would say I am quite satisfied with my job role here.
The old ideology of slow promotion is also gone now as you are eligible for promotion every three years under Fast track mode.
Coming to my own work experience here, we are one of the country's largest business holding development offices. So the work load is high. However you don't have to sit and work post the work time which is 5:45 pm from Monday to Thursday and 6:00pm on Friday . We all know the advantage of Saturday off which is also one of the major reasons why people are preferring insurance companies over banks to work with.
As an officer, you have to deal with underwriting, claims, umex (agent recruitment and business procurement), accounts etc. You will be given any one role to handle.
Gross Salary of an officer at United India is approx Rs. 48000. You will get a handsome salary in the beginning itself. Also they give you the option of taking housing on rent for which the limit is around Rs 17000 (only on production of rent receipt)in a metro city. So overall you get good Rs 65000.
Other facilities are medical lumpsum benefit, travel allowance, city compensatory allowance , baggage etc,.
The work culture is good in my DO. People are helping and manager is quite understandable. It also depends on how you work and handle situations in your professional life. So if you have good terms with everyone in your office, you will really enjoy a great time here.
I am currently loving the work I am doing here.

What will happen to Ireland and Northern Ireland now that Brexit has been triggered by Article 50?	"As already pointed out, we don?õ????t know. The Republic of Ireland didn?õ????t vote to leave, obviously, and doesn?õ????t want to anyway. Northern Ireland voted to stay. Theresa May has voiced diplomatic phrases in relation to the impact of Brexit on our island. But now that it?õ????s hammer time, the UK will have a lot more on its plate than worrying about ?õ????the other island?õ???ù.
The EU (of which the Republic of Ireland remains a committed member) has zero interest in making the exit process easy or predictable. Negotiations will be hard and long. The utterly inexcusable start to negotations by Britain (?õ????Do it our way, or we will stop helping to fight terrorism by sharing intelligence?õ???ù) will not help their case.
The impact of all this uncertainty on a neighbour - one more severely impacted by Brexit than any other - is not going unnoticed. Nor will be quickly forgotten.
There are both positive and negative implications for Ireland from Brexit, but until Britain rolls its sleeves up and finally shows up at the negotating table we are left swinging in the breeze. And with clowns like Boris Johnson involved, we will remain so for quite some time.
And at some point, Britain will realize that its current trade with the Republic of Ireland is larger than its current combined trade with Brazil, Russia, India and China - those famed new markets. Best of British with those chaps, fellas.

"What is a good analysis of the novel ""The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress"" by Robert A. Heinlein?"	"I am posting a couple of reviews of the book then will make my own comments.
This, like most Heinlein science fiction works is a well written book. Heinlein was a good writer who could crank out well written prose that could hold the reader?õ????s attention.
However, what really seperated Heinlein from most Science Fiction writers was that Heinlein would explore ideas and would question social taboos, and explore whether these taboos made any real sense.
Some people react extremely negatively toward Heinlein. Some call him a misogynist, or a fascist, or a racist all of which are absurd charges. Heinlein was one of the first Science Fiction writers to use strong capable female characters as heroines in stories, Heinlein used black and other race characters as protagonists in his stories, the hero in ?õ????Tunnel in the sky?õ???ù was black, the hero in ?õ????Starship Troopers?õ???ù was Filipino, the primary male character in ?õ????The Moon is a Harsh Mistress?õ???ù Manuel ""Mannie"" Garcia O'Kelly-Davis is multi-racial with a black grandfather from South Africa shipped to the moon for armed violence and no work permit, a Tartar Grandmother (a Turkic ethnic & language group from central Eurasia) shipped to the moon as political dissident, his other Grandmother was from the US and involuntarally shipped to the moon as a female type juvenile delinquent, other grandfather also a political dissident and I think Irish.
If you knew him from his personal life or his biographies you would know that the racist, fascist, or misogyny charges are ridiculous. He, working as an engineer for the US Navy during WWII threatend the dean of an engineering school over the dean refusing to admit female candidates for degree, with charges for endangering war production.
What in my opinion, annoys these people is Heinlein exporing ideas that they feel are sacred. Like whether polyamory and plural marriage arrangements (multiple husbands not just wives) is a viable system for a society. Like whether government is in the end a good thing or not.
This book goes into detail in philosophical exploration of the basis of government.
It also has one of the first well written treatments of a artificial intelligence.

One thing is evident, your ear does start to have shooting pain randomly. You get overwhelmed by hearing loud noises and your eyes start watering more often. Till now I have watched more than
Well, the ultimate result is that I have a buzzing sound in my left ear even when I watch short videos and music. I can't play loud music and watching movies at cinema hall is a total NO. It's not a big issue right now, but it can lead to permanent hearing impairment if I continue this practice. So from now on, I rely on phone?õ????s speaker to listen song as low as 10 to 14 on volume rocker. I browse a lot of stuff though so eyes aren't getting any better. Apart from that, you may face frequent headache as your eyes don't blink much when you concentrate on screen for too long. You will feel tired for hours, and as you are watching it sitting in a same posture, blood circulation decreases. That's not a good sign.
It's an addiction and can't be rid of in a day or week. If you want these sensory organs to function for long, reduce your active hours on devices. Keep it aside for an hour for start. Occupy yourself in other activities like do YOGA for sometime. That helps focus and reduces stress. Don't sit in same posture for more than an hour. Have a walk to the door or around the house, stretch and then sit again. Mobility is necessary for your body. Drink water, it improves concentration on your work.
I now don't watch TV like I used to do. It's abstinence and although it takes courage, ultimately you can master it. Ultimately your won't even want to open the TV or unlock your phone.

What is the general opinion of Kerala people about Sreeshanth as an election candidate?	"A2A;
With all due respect, '
After clearing all the charges by the Supreme Court, he was becoming more likeable for the Kerala People. And I think the decision for contesting the election was one big blunder.
Remember how Anurag Thakur opposed Sreesanth all the time even after he was cleared off all the charges by calling him corrupt. And now he is campaigning for him, supporting him; the hypocrisy.
Since BJP has not yet gained the prominence to win the elections in Kerala, mapping Sreesanth for Trivandrum shows how they lack a prominent leader from their party. If he was contested from Thripunithara, he might have won a better vote share. Trivandrum will not be easier for him.
I used to support Sreesanth and wanted him to play for the country again. Now he says the cricket might be over for him but he can do great things for the state. Well, we liked/disliked him as a cricketer and people who support them as a politician must ask themselves the change he can bring. People might have not forgotten the fact that he skipped election campaigns to act in the movie. So are people supporting someone who is unclear about his priorities?
The interview he had with a national news channel went viral as at the end the anchor was repeatedly saying , 'Well you are unclear about the problems and local issues the people have been facing. You don't know what they need. '
He said Kummanam is like Sachin Tendulkar and triggered avalanche of trolls and hate. The tweet in which he mentioned Kerala as a city (well, he actually meant Trivandrum, but that mistake was enough for the people to make fun of him. So imagine how people see him during these election time) went viral as well.
Anyway, let's see how he can make an impact in the elections. Less than half a month to go.?ˇ

Can you recommend a video and/or computer game (ideally one that is compatible with Mac) for a 27 year old woman with no prior gaming experience?	"So I would definitely recommend Bastion. It is a fantastic game with an excellent script and music. Its a totally different style than the Sims but it definitely met the engaging/captivating/interesting category you were looking for.
The next I would recommend the Portal Series. They are a puzzle FPS where you are trying to escape a testing facility. Its weirdly story driven even though your character is totally silent the entire game.
My final recommendation would be the Half-Life 2 game (there are episodes that add more on from the original game) Again this game has a silent protagonist but has an amazing story. Its made by the same people as the Portal so they are similar but its a bit more combat oriented.
Unfortunately a lot of the other games I would like to recommend are not available on Mac. Some of my favorite games for story content are the Mass Effect series, Elder Scrolls series and Fallout all of which have no Mac versions

One becomes a senior with 91 credits, but graduation could be more than a year away if they are not the right credits needed. I hope this helps.
Good luck!

How can the colonization of Mars be realistic when there is virtually no atmosphere? How could Mars colonists be protected from meteorites?	"Mars has ?õ????virtually no atmosphere?õ???ù only when you compare it to Earth and Venus. It really does have one, though, and a helpful one, at that: it allows incoming craft to aerobrake from interplanetary speeds to orbital speeds or landing-approach speeds without using any precious fuel.
Balloons, airplanes, and even ultralight drones using propellers can all generate enough lift to fly on Mars.
The Martian atmosphere is surprisingly complex, too, with weather patterns and trade winds and an ozone layer three times thicker than the one we boast about on Earth. Of course its ozone layer is many times less dense than ours, so it allows a lot more ultraviolet radiation through, but it is wrong to talk as if there isn?õ????t any atmosphere at all.
Ask anyone who has ever worked on a Mars probe or lander team and they will assure you that the Martian atmosphere is plenty thick enough to incinerate most small meteorites: the craft we send to Mars arrive at literally meteoric speeds, after all, and if the aerobraking approach isn?õ????t set up exactly right, the craft will either burn up in the Martian atmosphere (if it enters too steeply) or bounce right off the Martian atmosphere (if it enters not quite steeply enough and skips like a flat stone off a smooth lake, hurtling harmlessly into space). We can expect the same result for natural meteorites too. More of them will reach the surface of Mars than will reach the surface of the Earth, sure, but it?õ????s not like trying to pitch a tent in a hailstorm.
As for protecting colonists, Joseph is right: the principle of a Whipple shield works with other materials that are as strong as a thin sheet of steel, like kevlar and even some kinds of clear polyethylene membrane, especially if wedded to a kevlar mesh. To make a clear inflatable structure (such as for a greenhouse, or just a big dome to enclose a larger bit of real estate, maybe 200m diameter for starters) you would inflate one dome within the other, leaving a gap of several centimeters. For extra meteorite security, thermal insulation, and radiation protection, add a third layer. (Polyethylene plastic is actually a decent radiation barrier, although it will need a coating or additives to prevent decomposition and perhaps improve its SPF.) A small meteorite will hit the first layer and pulverize as it punches through, leaving it unable to pierce the second layer. Or at least the third layer, if it comes to that.
And yes, if the clear poly/kevlar dome is ?õ????catastrophically punctured?õ???ù then the habitat structures within the dome and/or beneath the ground will all be pressurizable retreats for safety. They will also be the living quarters, the labs and fabrication places, the galley and sick bay, etc. so the loss of an inflatable dome or greenhouse will be frustrating but not instantly catastrophic.
Colonization of Mars: Risky? Yes. Expensive? Yes. A huge hassle? Oh yes.
But realistic? Certainly.

Why are anti-aromatic compounds unstable?	"When you draw the molecular orbital energy diagram for anti aromatic compound ( it has special name i.e. frost musulin diagram),you will find that there are two unpaired electrons present in the anti bonding orbital which is higher in energy than bonding molecular orbital.

Do you believe everything you read on the internet?	"Woah! Most definitely not!
The key to separating truth from fiction is to ask the question: ?õ????How did the person who wrote this know that??õ???ù?õ????and ?õ????What are the motives of the person who wrote it??õ???ù
So?õ????if I look something up on Wikipedia - then we can click on the little blue numbers that are scattered through the document - which tells you where the information for that fact came from. You can then click on the link (or check out the book or whatever) and know where that information came from.
This is a VERY reliable way to separate truth from fiction.
Knowing WHY a piece of information might have been faked is important too. A large news site that?õ????s been around for a long time has a reputation to maintain - and if they post too much junk, that reputation will tarnish and they?õ????ll lose readership. So those sites are more likely to be reporting reliably. On the other hand, a small/new website has no reputation to maintain - and their main goal is to build readership rapidly and get enough ad revenue in to pay the rent. Those sites are far more likely to push out sensationalised garbage with enough shock value to bring in eyeballs?õ????so I trust them less.
When you?õ????re talking with an actual person - or on a site where the authors of documents engage with audience questions - you can ask ?õ????Where did you get that information??õ???ù - and if you aren?õ????t satisfied with the answer - then it may be garbage.
Another good guideline is: ?õ????Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence?õ???ù.
So, if I wrote ?õ????The temperature in Austin Texas reached 87 degrees today?õ???ù - that?õ????s not an uncommon thing - and it?õ????s likely to be correct. But if I say ?õ????The temperature in Austin Texas reached 130 degrees today?õ???ù - that?õ????s a VERY extraordinary claim - and you should expect me to prove it somehow before you?õ????d even consider believing it.
Another trick is to search for other sites that make similar claims. Do they all quote one single source? If so, we might have to judge the reliability of that single source. But if there are a variety of sources that pretty much agree (especially if there are small variations in what they say) - then that?õ????s generally more convincing.
But in the end - can you truly believe anything you didn?õ????t personally witness?
In practical terms, you can?õ????t function that way - you simply don?õ????t have the time or energy to research every single claim. So balance the importance of knowing something against the effort you spend to prove it.
For example - if I go to a store and a bottle of dish detergent says ?õ????Make your dishes cleaner than ANY other brand!?õ???ù - I?õ????m skeptical of it?õ????s truth, but it?õ????s not a life-changing matter - so I?õ????ll buy the stuff without checking. On the other hand, if I?õ????m buying a half million dollar house and the seller says that the building is in good condition, I?õ????m CERTAINLY going to bring in a professional house inspector to check out that claim?õ????I?õ????m going to demand that the previous owner include a year of home owner?õ????s warranty insurance, so any claims that turn out to be false can be fixed on their dollar?õ????I?õ????m going to walk around the place a couple of times and peer into every corner - look for cracks everywhere!
My degree of skepticism is very high for the dish detergent - and I assume the house seller is not a very dishonest person - but the degree of importance of the purchase means that I?õ????m going to do fact checking where it matters - and let slide the risk of false information where it really doesn?õ????t matter to me.

Why are this year's WrestleMania and its matches not so good?	"WrestleMania isn't interesting?
Wait am I still standing because I lost my mind with that statement.
We can't just say why isn't it interesting before Watching anything or any part of WrestleMania.
?õ????Ultimate Thrill and Ride?õ???ù a short roller coaster ride but you may have thaught that it is just a dialogue, wait let me give you few sneek picks of WrestleMania ramp.
The Ramps is from the top of the Stadium!
?õ????Right there Thumbnail, Shane McMahon will jump from top?õ???ù
We can't say anything unless we watch the whole WrestleMania.
Let us have a Quick Highlights of WrestleMania big match card.
Shane McMahon vs. AJ Styles, how will commissioner face off his own Talent. AJ Styles says that he is just better than Shane McMahon and he will and should be included in WWE Title Picture after Wrestlmania. Also, from where will Shane McMahon jump from?
Roman Reigns vs. Undertaker, who's yard is this now? It is dream match and this will be match of the night. It is alot anticipated?õ???? and also how will both of them complete.
John Cena & Nikki Bella vs. Miz & Maryse, it wasn't interested and anticipated in anyway. BUT, after the bad blood between John Cena and Miz this is now the match that lot of people will look for.
Randy Orton vs. Bray Wyatt, match that took about years to build. How will Randy Orton counter Bray and give us #OUTTANOWHERE also what has Bray Wyatt stored in his aresnal.
Kevin Owens vs. Chris Jericho, best freinds WAIT Chris Jericho was never Kevin Owens's best freind. Will Kevin Owens took everything from Chris Jericho after Chirs Jericho added him on the LIST?
Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg, after the humaliation (1:26) by Goldberg and after that Royal Rumble elimination how will Brock Lesnar react, also the price is Universal Championship.
It's alot great to see the Ultimate Thrill Ride.
WrestleMania is all great for this year! With hardship, vendetta and everything that will make this year's WrestleMania great and alot fun to watch.
But, why do you think that WrestleMania isn't interested that much?
Yes, you're not wrong. I understand. So what's the real reason?
Raw is the Flagship?õ????, every intensity of WrestleMania use to be build from RAW. The last Raw before WrestleMania, every single time was great but this year didn't seemed well.
The moment builder isn't strong enough so that you'll have hype for WrestleMania!
The only reason is 3hrs of Raw i.e falgship show of WWE isn't great enough for now, it's not building moment for WrestleMania so we aren't getting that kick start hype.

Why don't Japanese men wear shorts?	"Who said they don't? I see plenty of men in shorts every summer, both younger men and businessmen (on weekends), and even some older men.
Now it is true that shorts are considered informal. They are considered informal in the West as well, tho this attitude is fading more and more all the time and these days only older people are likely to remember a time when it wasn't so acceptable to wear shorts.
Before the 1900s, in the West, shorts were for boys only and once you graduated to long pants you were expected to only wear long pants for the rest of your life. Even in the more casual atmosphere of today, this feeling is still hanging around. When I was in college 20 years ago in America I was told that men should never wear shorts if they wanted to give a good impression. That was only 20 years ago.
In Japan I think the attitude is much the same: shorts are considered informal and for boys or young people only. As Japanese society becomes more casual, this attitude is falling away, which is why you can see many Japanese men in shorts today, but some people still feel it.

How do you feel about Obamacare?	"Future historians will look back at the ACA as a step in the process that led to fully socialized single-payer medical care in the USA. Single-payer universal health care is inevitable for America.
I personally ?õ????feel?õ???ù disgusted with my experience with ?õ????Obamacare?õ???ù, because this year I had to go to the least-expensive option available in my State which pays nothing until I?õ????ve spent my $6,000.00 deductible. That means I pay $340.00/mo for what amounts to catastrophic coverage?õ????If I come down with some horribly expensive disease or am in a serious accident, I?õ????ll cough up my almost-seven grand and then ?õ????Ambetter?õ???ù will pick up the rest?õ????for one year?õ????s expenses over that deductible.
INTERESTINGLY, my new insurance company, like many others, does NOT cover either diagnostic tests, screenings like mammograms OR prescription drugs?õ????like, for example, Metformin if I had diabetes or meds for high BP if I had high BP or cholesterol-lowering drugs if I had high cholesterol, etc?õ????.IF I had any of these conditions, I would either have to pay the full price or?õ????go without. If I decided to go without, I?õ????d be much, much more likely to get REALLY sick, quickly pay up my deductible and my new insurance company would pay big fat bucks so long as I was surviving my heart attack or stroke or amputation or all-of-the-above.
Ergo, not paying anything for either diagnostic tests/screenings OR the prescription drugs that keep people from suffering the very expensive consequences of, for example, diabetes, high BP or high cholesterol, means that ?õ????Ambetter?õ???ù is gambling that I?õ????ll die or die soon enough that they won?õ????t actually have to shell out the hundreds of thousands of dollars they would have to pay for every year I might struggle on while suffering the consequences of conditions that could have been prevented, especially if they were caught in time by tests/screenings and treated with the appropriate prescription drugs.
Ambetter, and their ilk, are hoping that all those public health advisories that people my age get like mammograms, colonoscopies, screening for diabetes and high blood pressure will motivate me to get myself tested at my own expense. Ambetter, et al, are wrong, wrong, wrong. I am most assuredly NEVER going to submit to miserable, humiliating medical tests/screenings unless they are free or at very low cost?õ????That?õ????s the way my brain works, and that?õ????s the way a lot of others?õ???? brains work too?õ????..It goes like this:?õ????IF the state or the insurance company would like to minimize their spending on my health by me being as healthy as possible, my part of the ?õ????bargain?õ???ù will be to sacrifice my time, dignity and comfort (even a very reasonable co-pay) to submit to diagnostic tests and screenings. What I am NOT going to do is sacrifice my time, dignity and comfort and PAY BIG BUCKS FOR THE PRIVILEGE.
Since I am definitely NOT going to pay for those tests/screenings, I won?õ????t ever have a prescription for any of those drugs that treat high BP, diabetes, etc?õ????.So, unless and even IF I were to dedicate myself to doing everything possible to maintain and improve my health (no, I?õ????m not going to become an obsessive health nut), at my age I am going to get hit with a seriously expensive health crisis sooner or later and I am more likely than not to survive that crisis due to very, very expensive long-term intensive medical interventions?õ????..Which Ambetter is going to pay for all but approx. $7,000.00?õ????.That $7,000.00 I?õ????d pay every year is a teeny-tiny drop in the bucket compared to what Ambetter will end up paying for my heart attack or stroke or amputation or breast/colon cancer treatment.
It?õ????s soooo stupid.
Part of the pitch for Obamacare was that IF ONLY the un-and-under-insured could have access to free/affordable health screening for the BIG KILLERS, many of which can be very effectively treated with prescription drugs, the overall cost of health care would be drastically reduced!?õ????Well, I have ?õ????Obamacare?õ???ù that pays nothing for tests, screenings or prescription drugs, so the preventative cost-savings that made so much sense are kaput?õ????IN FACT, my premium is still high enough that I am even LESS motivated to submit to the tests/screenings that all the public health advisories nag about.
My almost-seven thousand dollar deductible plus my $4,000.00 + in premiums means I shell out only $10K of the full price of, say a heart attack or treatment for breast cancer?õ????Bad as it is, it?õ????ll be a better deal for me than my insurance company who will pay aprox:
?õ????The average cost to traditional health insurers for the first 90 days following a heart attack is
OR, How about I find a lump in my breast?õ????it?õ????ll be a fair size by then because it would not have been detected by a ?õ????routine?õ???ù mammogram:
?õ????Depending on the individual case and the type and number of treatments needed, the total cost of breast cancer treatment, on average, can reach
SO, in anticipation of getting seriously sick, I?õ????m starting the process of moving my assets to my kids as soon as I sell my house I?õ????m remodeling. This will prevent medicare from seizing my assets once I can no longer pay for my own medical care. Do I feel ashamed or guilty about this?. ..WHY NO, I do NOT. I don?õ????t because I?õ????ve been a responsible, tax-paying, health-conscious citizen my whole life. Unlike the many, many indigent Americans and even illegal immigrants who don?õ????t pay for their health care, I pay a substantial health insurance premium every month for what amounts to only worst-case catastrophic health care once I?õ????ve paid another $7,000.00 on top of my premiums?õ????.And so the fucking insurance company and the state can fight it out about who is going to pay for what, when the time comes?õ????.While my kids and grandkids enjoy whatever I have managed to transfer to them.?õ????Unless and until the nation finally grows up and realizes that we have had the most expensive and least fair form of ?õ????socialized medicine?õ???ù for many decades and we decide to create our single-payer universal health care system that is so long overdue.

What is the proper way of asking a day off from my supervisor?	"Some workplaces have a formal process by which to request time/days off.?ˇ Learn what that policy/process is and use it.?ˇ Otherwise, just ask your boss, with as much lead-time as possible, for the day off you need, and give them a reasonable reason why you want the time off.
Since each employer handles leave requests differently, there is no one right answer to this question.?ˇ Some award PTO (paid time off) which you can take for any reason.?ˇ Others give you a certain number of days/hours of ""sick leave,"" ""vacation,"" ""personal"" and/or ""bereavement"" leave.?ˇ
Obviously, it's very hard to schedule ""bereavement"" leave in advance, but organizations will, except for that or another emergency, expect you to make your request some number of days in advance, and if there are conflicts between when you and a co-worker want to take time off, and at least one of you needs to be ""on duty,"" usually the employee with the most seniority gets the requested time off.
If you work in an organization with a highly organized/defined ""time off"" policy, then you need to follow the policy.?ˇ But, what happens if your request doesn't fall neatly in to the defined types of ""leave"" mentioned in the policy?
For example, suppose your mother or father has a massive stroke and is in a coma from which they are not expected to emerge. You need to go to home, some distance from where you live now, to meet with your family about whether or not to take Mom or Dad off life support.?ˇ And, if the decision is made to end life support, you want a chance to ""say goodbye"" to your parent before the machines are turned off. Your parent isn't quite ""dead"" yet, so perhaps bereavement leave is not the appropriate request.?ˇ
Do you request ""vacation"" or other paid time off and then switch to ""unscheduled"" bereavement leave when the life support machines are turned off and your parent dies??ˇ Hopefully you will have a manager to whom you can explain the situation and who tells you ""just go and be with your family, keep in touch with me, and we will figure this all out when you get back.""?ˇ Not all of us are so fortunate, however.

How does one get over a severe trauma?	"What you have asked is a subject of intense research and perhaps will lead us to a cure against the persistence of high levels of glucocorticoids after a major stress of trauma: Severe Trauma is emotional trauma which put victims in double jeopardy, not only from searing the psyche, but physically damaging the brain.
New studies in trauma victims as diverse as Vietnam combat veterans and victims of childhood sexual abuse have found a shrinkage in the size of the hippocampus, a brain structure vital to learning and memory.
Sustained stress can have numerous pathologic effects. Among the molecules that mediate such effects are the adrenal steroid hormones, including the human glucocorticoid (GC) hydrocortisone. Along with epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine, GCs that are essential for surviving acute physical trauma.
The very hormones that flood the brain to mobilize it in the face of an overwhelming threat can be, later, toxic to cells in the hippocampus, the studies suggest.
in a thoughtful statement:""The idea that severe stress or trauma can actually damage the brain is remarkable,"" said Dr. Dennis Charney, chief of psychiatry at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Haven, Conn.
The symptoms of post-traumatic stress (PTSP) include nightmares and vivid flashbacks of the traumatic moment; being fearful and easily startled; having intrusive and disturbing memories of the trauma; irritability, and difficulty concentrating.
Combat veterans who still suffer from post-traumatic stress symptoms from the Vietnam war have an 8% reduction in the volume of their right hippocampus compared with vets who suffered no such symptoms, according to a report in the issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry by a team led by Dr. J. Douglas Bremner and including Dr. Charney, at the West Haven hospital.
And both combat veterans and and survivors of childhood abuse performed at levels averaging 40% lower on a test of verbal memory than did people of comparable age and education. While such symptoms are commonly understood to be psychological problems, some or all of them may well be related to the physical effects of extreme stress on the brain. Dr. Bremner said in a report published in Psychiatry Research.
The traumatized veterans with reduced hippocampus volume were compared with other veterans who had similar backgrounds, body size and other characteristics that might affect brain size, but who had no trauma symptoms. Shrinkage in the hippocampus suggests a loss of cell mass: whether the loss is due to the atrophy of dendrites, the long branches that stretch from one brain cell to another, or from the death of such cells, is not yet known.
""The rule of thumb is that no matter what kind of trauma -- an earthquake, combat, rape -- only about 15 percent of victims will get long-lasting, severe post-trauma symptoms,"" said Douglas Bremner.
Dr. Bremner's finding of hippocampus effects is the first to be published, at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in Miami.
Dr. Murray Stein, a psychiatrist at the University of California at San Diego, also found a 7 percent reduction in hippocampus volume in women who had suffered repeated childhood sexual abuse and who still had post-traumatic symptoms.
Another study of Vietnam veterans found that those who saw more intense combat and suffered from more severe post-trauma symptoms had an average shrinkage of 26% in the left hippocampus and 22% in the right hippocampus, compared with vets who saw combat but had no symptoms. That finding, was also reported at the psychiatry meeting, was by Dr. Tamara Gurvits and Dr. Pitman.
And in new preliminary data, Dr. Bremner also found a loss of hippocampus volume among adults who were victims of repeated physical or sexual abuse as children. Two-thirds of the abuse victims were men, and all still had post-traumatic symptoms as a result of the abuse. ""The abuse was extreme,"" said Dr. Bremner, ""including being raped or otherwise sexually penetrated regularly, or being routinely hit, burned or otherwise physically abused over a year or longer.""
The memory of those with post-traumatic symptoms was particularly faulty for words, like grocery lists or phone numbers. Using a test in which people hear a story and then repeat it back immediately and again 15 minutes later, found a 40% deficit in the accuracy of short-term memory in trauma victims compared with people of similar age and background.
The study found no deficiency in the trauma victims' overall I.Q. scores, nor in other kinds of memory, like that for things they had seen or for vocabulary.
""The hippocampus is crucial for short-term verbal memory,"" said Dr. Bremner.
The shrinkage in the hippocampus may be due to the effects of heightened levels of cortisol, a steroid hormone secreted by the brain in response to emergencies, some researchers believe. ""Cortisol can be toxic to the hippocampus,"" said Dr. Bremner.
Findings suggest that glucocorticoids, ""may be neurotoxic to the hippocampus at the massive levels that are released under extreme stress or during trauma,"" said Dr. Robert Sapolsky, a neuroscientist at Stanford University.
""Cortisol is a major means the body uses, with adrenaline, to arouse itself so quickly; its action, for example, triggers an increase in blood pressure and mobilizes energy from fat tissue and the liver. ""The dark side of this picture is the neurological effects,"" said Dr. Sapolsky.
""It's necessary for survival, but it can be disastrous if you secrete cortisol for months or years on end. We've known it could lead to stress-exacerbated diseases like hypertension or adult onset diabetes. But now we're finding the hippocampus is also damaged by these secretions...it eventually kills neurons in the hippocampus,"" said Dr. Sapolsky. ""The hippocampus is essential for transferring such facts from short-term to long-term memory,"" said Dr. Sapolsky. ""There are mixed findings on cortisol levels in trauma victims, with some researchers finding very high levels and others finding very low levels,"" said Dr. Sapolsky. ""Biologically speaking, there may be different kinds of post-traumatic stress.""
In a series of studies, Dr. Yehuda has found that those post-trauma patients who have low cortisol levels also seem to have ""a hypersensitivity in cell receptors for cortisol,"" she said. To protect itself, the body seems to reset its cortisol levels at a lower point.
The low cortisol levels ""seem paradoxical, but both too much and too little can be bad,"" said Dr. Yehuda. ""There are different kinds of cells in various regions of the hippocampus that react to cortisol. Some atrophy or die if there is too little cortisol, some if there is too much.""
Dr. Rachel Yehuda added, ""In a brain scan, there's no way to know exactly which cells have died."" To be sure that the shrinkage found in the hippocampus of trauma victims is indeed because of the events they suffered through, researchers are now turning to prospective studies, where before-and-after brain images can be made of people who have not yet undergone trauma, but are at high risk, or who have undergone it so recently that cell death has not had time to occur.
Dr. Charney, is planning to take M.R.I. scans of the brains of emergency workers like police officers and firefighters and hopes to do the same with young inner-city children, who are at very high risk of being traumatized over the course of childhood and adolescence. Dr. Pitman, with Dr. Yehuda, plans a similar study of trauma victims in Israel as they are being treated in emergency rooms.
Dr. Yehuda held out some hope for people who have suffered through traumatic events. ""It's not necessarily the case that if you've been traumatized your hippocampus is smaller,"" she said. She cited research with rats by Dr. Bruce McEwen, a neuroscientist at Rockefeller University, showing that atrophied dendritic extensions to other cells in the hippocampus grew back when the rats were given drugs that blocked stress hormones.
Dr. Sapolsky stated: ""If the loss of hippocampal volume in trauma victims is due to the atrophy of dendrites rather than to cell death, then it is potentially reversible, or may be so one day,"" he said.

"If the phasers in Star Trek have a stun setting, why don't the crew members just shoot everyone all the time at the slightest hint of trouble?"	"You can kill someone with a phaser set to stun.* As far as pain goes, think of stun not as a free way to knock out an enemy, but more like a military unit using ?õ????less than lethal?õ???ù weaponry. Rubber bullets and so forth will hurt people, and can, in rare circumstances kill them.
Starfleet is an interstellar navy, so officers planetside behave as though they were naval officers in port, or maybe embassy marines. A military unit in a foreign country can?õ????t use force indiscriminately, they have to ramp up force per a set of rules of engagement. Any use of force by a military unit in another nation?õ????s jurisdiction can foul up diplomatic efforts, and in extreme cases caused a war. Force has to be a last resort - especially in TNG - diplomacy is preferred, and force has to be used on the continuum as it is justified by the situation on the ground.
Starfleet officers on a ship are more like 18th century British navy. Through the TOS and TNG series the writing is informed by Horatio Hornblower and Patrick O?õ???? Brian?õ????s Aubrey-Maturin tales. Weapons are typically kept in storage unless the situation calls for wearing sidearms, either as part of formal dress, because of the status of the location the ship is in, or because of the force posture of Starfleet.?õ???ˇ
All of that to say, using a sidearm is an action of consequence in the Star Trek universe. Shooting first and asking questions later doesn?õ????t work in Picard?õ????s time. Kirk?õ????s time was a bit more wild west.
From a technology perspective, I believe they stipulate a recycle time between shots -although you get a steady plasma stream when you?õ????re on the cutting setting.

"I have a fragile ego. So when people criticize me, I retaliate and hit them back with double the force. How can I strengthen my ego?"	"A fragile ego means an insecure ego, which feels threatened whenever you face a situation in which the idea of your imagined self is shaken. This happens because there are subconscious beliefs that tell you that you are perhaps unlovable, not good enough giving rise to insecurities. In order to counter those, as a self-defense mechanism you have built this strong image of yourself on top of those (trying to convince yourself that you actually have many noble characteristics, whatever they may be in your case).
When someone criticizes you, it resonates with those subconscious negative beliefs about yourself, reinforces them, making you feel hurt. Then as a defense you attack the one who unknowingly touched your deeper insecurities reminding you about them.
Therefore, strengthening your ego, that is, making yourself believe even more strongly on your desirable self-image, certainly won?õ????t be a good solution. Those hidden insecurities will keep coming up in one way or another, until addressed and resolved.
When you no longer have those negative subconscious beliefs about yourself, you won?õ????t even notice someone criticizing you. Criticism won?õ????t resonate with you and you will be immune to whatever others say about you or your work.

Is it cool for a girl to spend the night at her male friends place when she has a boyfriend?	"How does it make your partner feel if you were to stay at a guys house?
We must see the basis of what a relationship actually is and look to the qualities it portrays - to your wish and your partners wish for mutual content and happiness.
The context of the relationship will change, for example is the couple living with each other now, how long have they been together, and what is important to both persons, and what
Important qualities in a relationship that must not be taken from include:
Jelousy is a good thing and is needed in attraction, and it will keep the relationship lively and fun. But is it appropriate in the context of
Short answer is no, it is not ok.
Also the reason for staying at his house wasn't provided, so I am going with the typical reasons. You are staying at this guys house for fun and friendship, well if that's the case, do it during he day when it's not suspicious and when it won't cause a problem, or do it on your partners terms. Which really goes into the next point which is: what is most important to your partner, because what is most important to them, should be important to you, to have a good relationship.
If you stay at this guys place, and your partner doesn't like it, then don't do it, otherwise your relationship won't be healthy and fun. It's about communication between you and your partner, so figure out the communication part before you start thinking about staying at someone's house.

"In 4 months, I want to go from writing C+ papers to A+ papers. Is this possible?"	"I agree with the two answers as to the mechanics, but keep in mind that there?õ????s a social aspect to grading. If you are taking one course and you want to go from C+ to A+ within that one course (or multiple courses with the same instructor), you have to take into account that teachers (like all humans) stereotype people. If you simply improved your writing such that you suddenly wrote an A+ paper while before you were writing C+, the teacher will either assume you didn?õ????t write it (cheated), or will give you a B instead of an A, because in their mind you aren?õ????t the kind of person who gets As.
So if you are in fact hoping to improve in the eyes of one instructor, you have to enlist them into the process, so that they are aware you are doing it. In general, demonstrating (not merely saying) to a teacher that you are working hard on improving in their subject is going to make them like you a lot. This both helps the grade (we are all subjective), and would make them very willing to help you improve further, at the very least by having them try harder in class when answering your questions, etc.
So I would advise going to the office hours of the teacher (or talking to them after class) and telling them in the beginning of the term that you set a goal to improve, and that you are taking concrete steps (list them), and ask for help and advice. Don?õ????t bring the A+ thing or any question of grades, just tell them you are trying to learn to write better. And then after you write a paper and they grade it, come to them again, and ask for feedback. Try to explicitly do what they tell you (whatever it is). And do that every time after you submit an assignment. Whether you get your A+ or not, you will be successful in that course, and the teacher would write you glowing recommendations if you ever need them to, because just being a person who tries sets you apart in most places.

What are some bitter truths about this world?	"Well, this world is different for everyone who lives in it. This world is meant to give a purpose for every creature who resides in it. The purpose may vary from creature to creature. For some they see purpose through their religion and they see it as the real truth for existence. Some see purpose for residing in this world through relationships. Some see the world is useless place of hell, with infinte problems and so on.
The world in reallity doesn't not hold any bitter truth as such, it is just meant to be an experience to understand your inner self, in the cycle of progress of life, which is again not clearer to my mind. The bitter truth about world is that it can never really be understood from a human perspective. If the truth needs to be known we must know the direction to which it is going through .
There is nothing as such as truth and false in this world, it is all being created with those human minds who does not understand their inner self or who has lesser capacity to understand it.
The bitter truth about this world is that its reason for existence as such now is unknown, to vast tiny creatures living on it , except humans who acts superior and hardly knows nothing about it.
This is my perspective through my mind which the world exists. Thank you for the question.

They are very large creatures but they swim quite slowly. Evan an accidental human death by tail swipe is nearly impossible and has never been reported.
I highly recommend visiting the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta to see these gentle giants in person. You can snorkel or scuba dive in their main tank for a reasonable fee, it's about the size of a US football field. It's not much more expensive than scuba diving at a diving resort, and you will be next to these sharks for a full 30+ minutes instead of searching for them and trying to catch up to them in the open sea:
If you live closer to Asia, you can also see whale sharks up close in the incredible Okinawa Aquarium of Japan:
If you prefer to see them in their natural habitat, you can find them in Mexico, at Isla Holbox, which is a 25-minute boat ride from the mainland, about 150 km north of Cancun. The whale sharks arrive to feed and mate in July to August (peak season).
If you live closer to Asia, you can also find them roaming wild in Donsol, Philippines, one of the few confirmed
Even at this location, the odds of you actually finding a baby whale shark is much less than 1%. Eco-tourism has been so popular in some towns that the locals started feeding the whales daily to attract them in large numbers. Some animal advocacy groups have expressed concern and outrage because deliberately feeding these whales for the purposes of eco-tourism will disturb their natural migratory patterns and prevent them from interacting with whale sharks from other continents, potentially affecting their genetic diversity.

How do you speed up the process of your braces?	"Don't double up on the elastics, this does not mean it will progress faster. If your orthodontist wants you to do it, they will tell you to do it.
If they prescribe headgear- WEAR IT. Every night, even when it hurts. Hurting is a sign that things they-are-a-changing. Ibuprofen pills are better than having to wear braces longer than necessary.
If a bracket comes loose or breaks off, this will essentially halt the progress of your braces. Braces work by exerting small force over a long period of time.
I think about it like this- if you are pushing a rock up a hill every day all day, it is easier to use a small amount of force over time.
However, imagine if you let go of the rock? What would happen? The rock would go back down the hill! Braces are like that.
Chips, nuts, chewy and sticky foods can get caught in your brackets thereby causing your braces to snap off. Believe it or not, our masseter muscles, which are used to masticate food, are the strongest muscles in our body (compared to its size)!
Imagine now if there is a cashew piece stuck in your bracket- the combination of your teeth and muscles will try to bite down on this cashew. Something?õ????s gotta give, so the bracket does!
Therefore, if you don't keep the appointments, you aren't making any progress and your teeth are getting used to being in that orientation. If your treatment isn't finished, you don't want your teeth to stay like that!
The process of braces is aided by bone formation and reabsortption process. There are two types of cells responsible for this: osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
You have an appointment every five weeks because the orthodontist doesn't necessarily want this process to fully form. She wants you to maintain a state of equilibrium which allows for more pliability.
But don't use it right away when you feel rubbing against the inside of your mouth. You actually want there to be rubbing so your body will form a scar to protect that area.
You have to floss. My old dentist used to tell me that you only need to floss the teeth you want to keep . If you get a cavity during treatment, you will slow your progress because the orthodontist will have to take out anything that would hinder the dentist?õ????s work.

"How can I improve my score in PTE Academic Writing, Reading and Listening modules?"	"Pearson Test of English commonly known as PTE is designed to check the English eligibility of a candidate who aspire to go abroad for study or for permanent residency. Like IELTS, it has four modules : Listening, Writing, Reading and Speaking. For attaining good bands ,first he should have sound knowledge of English Language. After this, he needs to learn the format of the exam. Further, he requires to practice complete mock test .Once he will practice mock test, he will come to know about his weak area.
There are certain tips that will help you to score well in Reading, Writing and Listening :
In summarize Spoken Text, make a note while listening to the text; leave the vowels and practice can save a lot of time. Use the words, ?õ????The speaker says in the beginning?õ???ù. Concentrate on topic sentences and repeated words. In Fill in the Blanks; note the answers in erasable notepad given by them and later fill the answers. Check the spellings, Plurals.
Manage your time in summarize spoken text. Plan for 3 minutes, write for 5 minutes, and check spellings and grammar for 2 minutes.
Multiple answers types have the Negative marking. Most of the time answers rate of speech is fast so be careful and listen. Answers are mostly paraphrased. Most of the answers you can find at ending of listening so listen until it is assured.
This is the last activity . It is mandatory to listen the sentence very carefully only then one can be able to write it within given time.
Do check spellings while writing from dictation.
Reading can be improved by adopting various techniques:
Concentrate on parts of speech before and after the blank in fill in the blanks section, it helps in finding the omitted word. Select the word, which collocates with words beside it.
Read the question before you read the text. This will tell you what information you will be reading for. Reading question keeps you focused about the information you are looking for in the passage.
Always scan the answer choices to further help you focus on the information you will be reading for.
Skim the text to get information of its main idea and general content. You should know what the passage is about. Learn skimming the whole passage. The benefit of this technique is, it help you finding the correct answer.
Read the question and the answer options again. Select the correct answer if you know it. If you are not sure about the correct answer, eliminate any options that are apparently incorrect. Choose from remaining options.
If you do not know the answer, and are unable to eliminate any options, make a guess. Never leave any question unanswered. If you leave the question unanswered, it will be marked as incorrect. By guessing, you have the possibility of answering correctly.
While attempting writing tasks, use correct punctuation: commas, full stops, capital letters, etc. When asked to summarize text, make sure that your response must be between 5 to 75 words. Responses less than 5 words and more than 75 words will not be scored.
While writing an essay, identify the main topic; areas one needs to focus upon and any specific point of view that you might be asked to take. Keep in mind the word limit which is usually between 200-300 words.
In brief , I would say the major requirement of getting good scores in PTE is to do practice as much as you can.
Hope this helps!

"If you were 20 years old again, what would you do differently?"	"My early 20s were cool and exciting, but at times also
In my early 20s (and for a stretch before and after), most of my waking moments were occupied by thoughts that in retrospect were mostly needless. Picturing stuff that could happen, imagining vignettes where so and so I were engaged in some acrimonious debate, ultimately getting kind of lost in these weird imaginary conversations. And my conscious mind was over analytical and blocking the ability of my body and consciousness to connect to the moment. This leads to stress, unrealized potential, wasted energy and more. What?õ????s more, it clouds out the ?õ????inner voice?õ???ù that guides us toward the optimal paths and outcomes of our lives.
There is no shortage of philosophies, belief systems, practices, self-help books, etc aimed at reprogramming one?õ????s mind. I wrote up my own perspective on this here, tied to the mantra
Meditation and general mindfulness / being in the moment are what it?õ????s all about. I?õ????m not sure I would be ready to embrace this at age 20, but I?õ????m sure I would?õ????ve appreciated someone conveying this message and leaving it with me to digest.
In recent years I have shared with friends a personal theory. The concept is that each of us has a finite amount of life force for the length of your physical life. You can think of it as Life Capital - it is the single input we have to drive all of our experiences. We can spend life capital on anything -- sleeping, eating, watching TV, practicing an instrument, studying, performing in front of an audience, working a job, partying, what have you -- but we can never get it back once it is spent.
Some unknown quantity of life capital is required for any single activity or pursuit to blossom. This principal and the finite nature of life capital provides the basis for economic tradeoffs -- time spent on activity #1 detracts from the pool of available life capital for activities #2, #3, etc all the way through to activity n for some ""n"" number of total activities. This ability to trade off can be a good thing -- perhaps you are studying programming and you are regularly staying up until 330am working on a project, thereby reallocating life capital that might normally be spent on sleep and borrowing from the integrity of the life capital that will be spent the next day at your job. The can also arguably not be a good thing -- imagine you are still staying up until 330am but instead of programming you are playing video games. Perhaps the gaming fosters some sort of tech edification or otherwise inspires you to learn about programming. But perhaps it is instead a black hole for time with the potential to deliver little value.
Take inventory of how you spend your time and, thereby, your life capital. This is not an argument for expunging all ""fun"" activities and only focusing on ""productive"" activities (whatever that means). Rather, this is about introspection and aligning the use of your life force with your goals. If 75% of your life capital is spent on pleasure seeking, after a period of time you may find that you have been thoroughly entertained, but you may also find that you haven't progressed much in other ways. What you do with your time will fundamentally define what your life becomes. This is the kind of calculus that helps you avoid the common mid-life realization many have -- ""wow, I always wanted to do THAT, but instead it feels like I'm locked into doing THIS.""
For me, at age 20 I spent much of my life capital on ?õ????hanging out.?õ???ù Didn?õ????t go to class much. Certainly didn?õ????t study. I just kind of floated by with an optimization toward expending minimal effort. The outcome was that there was some latency in my career ?õ???? I didn?õ????t even find my calling in technology until I was 29.
Age 20 would be a great time to embrace the philosophy is that it's never too late to make a desired change... until we are dead. You've always wanted to play guitar? Cool, start studying it. You wish you were a lawyer? Awesome, go to law school. By no means am I meaning to trivialize what it would take to make any number of drastic changes that could fundamentally reinvent one's livelihood. However, I do firmly believe that we can be anything we choose to be, and do anything we choose to do, so long as we put in the proper time on the pathway to get there.
I have a friend from college who entered medical school at age 32. I have a father who grew up being told he wasn't going to amount to much and ultimately lifted himself up into a career earning patents in material sciences engineering. I have seen too much to lead me to believe that we are bound to life sentences that are not malleable under our influence.
I was pretty set in my ways at age 20 that certain doors had closed. What power could I have unlocked had I instead assumed all doors were open. I didn?õ????t realize this until 10+ years later.

"Kriti is everything we?õ????d expect from a newcomer and her acting and screen presence has come in for a lot of praise from critics.She is just two years old in Bollywood but has already managed to bag four films, including one with superstar shah Rukh Khan.
She is already known for being an extremely confident actress and even won several awards for Best Debut Actor for her first film.
She has all the qualities wih her to be an actress .she has the urge to learn and grow with every performance.she is personally never satisfied and keeps Learning from your experience with every film and keep improving upon it is an essential quality. She is of the view that when anactress thinks they have achieved everything they become stagnant.

"What would a society be like with mandatory concealed carry, meaning every citizen is required to carry a pistol at all times?"	"There is no evidence for that situation.
However there are a few close parallels: Places where citizens are required to OWN firearms (not necessarily carry them.)
Generally the crime is much lower and there is no significant increase in the problems that hysterical people will hallucinate might happen.
They just don?õ????t happen ?õ???? crime goes down.
Combine that with place which have ?õ????constitutional carry?õ???ù where any CAN carry and they also have no significant problems with a decrease in violent crime.
Finally, since NO gun control law actually works, there is no really reason to expect problems.
PRESUMABLY if one were to enact such a mandate, there would be mandatory training to go with it.
I would be on much less crime. (Quite a large amount actually.)

Can an atheist explain why organisms reproduce?	"?õ????Can an atheist explain why nature feels the need to reproduce??õ???ù
Nature? What a totally weird word to use.
I?õ????m pretty sure you don?õ????t mean the scientific journal
So what do you mean?õ????
Wikipedia defines nature thus?õ????
?õ????
and
?õ????Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects?õ????the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.?õ???ù
Why am I being fussy about this definition?
Because
If you wanted to ask a more useful and coherent question you might ask why ?õ????animals?õ???ù or ?õ????plants?õ???ù feel the need to reproduce. For that matter, you might ask a biologist, who would be someone who studies such things, and not an atheist.
But then the answer to your question isn?õ????t that hard to figure out?õ???? even for me?õ???? who?õ????s not a biologist.
Plants and animals that can?õ????t be bothered to reproduce?õ???? got out competed by the plants and animals that did.
Which is about as obvious as things get.

Who is the Team India (Cricket) vice captain across all 3 formats?	"The vice captain of Indian Test team is Ajinkya Rahane . He is most popular batsman in Indian team and we can convince as well. His performance in test match is extremelly well and he deserves the post of vice captain. But for Indian ODI or T20 Cricket team, BCCI has not named any player for vice captain beacuse MSD is available. But as we go for champions Trophy it is likely that a regular Vice Caption will be announced.
Looking the Indian team, Rohit Sharma is leading Candidate for vice caption because Ajinkya is not a stable player in limited overs and Ashwin also not seem to be promising as a limited over cricketer. Also Rohit is captain of Mumbai Indians that?õ????s also support him for Vice Captain. While Virat Kohli is a bit aggressive, Rohit Sharma can bring a bit of calmness to the side along with MS Dhoni.

What are top high pr doffollow social bookmarking sites?	"I am not sure if you are asking the correct question in 2017. Page rank is 100% dead now. It means your site metrics wont change if you get a link from a PR 6 domain instead of a PR 2 domain.
Many marketers found out ways to manipulate PR and that is why it is officially dead now. PR is no more considered a metric for judging websites or getting links from them.
You can go ahead and build as many high PR links as you want - they simply wont help. Period.
The answer is Trust Flow. You need to build links to your site from relevant domains - domains which have a high TF. The more relevant links you build the more juice it will pass.
If we consider two cases:
In 99 out of 100 cases, the link which you will get from Case 2 will be much more valuable.
If links from Case 1 were valuable, SEO would become a child?õ????s play and everyone would simply order Fiverr gigs and rank.
Do not waste your time building junk social bookmarking links. I can guarantee that they serve no purpose in ranking your site.
The answer is easy but the process isnt. Get links from related high TF, DA, CF domains. You will be surprised to see the power related links have. I have recently released a thorugh course on it, called
I am sure that once you go thorugh this course, you will have all the information that you need to rank sites consitenly in the same ways in which 6 figure affiliates are doing.

Does it take the same time for any substance to reach 50 degrees from 25 as it takes to reach 25 degrees from 0?	"In one word the answer is ?õ????No?õ????.
You have to provide heat to a substance to increase its temperature. So it's temperature increase depends on the heat transfer rate and also heat rejection rate.
If you have insulated the substance completely then we may assume that the substance is not rejecting any heat. In this case we can consider the heat transfer rate equation :
q = k A (dT/dx) ; where ?õ????q?õ???? is heat transfer rate ; k is heat transfer coefficient, A is area perpendicular to the heat transfer direction, dT/dx is temperature gradient.
Now as ?õ????dT?õ???? ( temperature difference between heat source and substance) decreases, the heat transfer rate decreases. When the temp of substance is 0 Celsius value of dT/dx is high with compare to when substance is at 25 Celsius.
So heat transfer rate is high for 0 to 25 Celsius with respect to 25 to 50. Hence time taken for 25 to 50 is more than time taken for 0 to 25.
Note: assuming the temperature of source is constant for both cases.

How can a mechanical engineer earn more than a computer engineer?	"Which benchmark do you want to seek? For the richest Indian the next benchmark could be a Bill Gates. If earning more than someone is your goal then you need not have to be an engineer at all. You just have to select a domain for business, set a goal, save money, invest, slog, bill, collect and earn.
If you want to be a mechanical engineer and earn more than a software engineer you can do so as well. You may want to be an entrepreneur with a product and /or service which only you can supply /provide and when there is a market for such a product /service. There are several ways to do so. Mechanical Engineering domain is cool and vast. The number of sound heads are relatively low nowadays as a lot of Graduate mech engineers are getting attracted by the comfort of IT/ITES. Nothing wrong with it. This may be an opportunity for some people who have opted to be with what others may see with disdain as Blue collared domain but it's actually not.

Will Quora be gone in the near future?	"I very well could be wrong, but
Although many users are being banned (or just leaving on their own terms), Quora is not really on a downward spiral.
New users flood in every day, new content is posted every second, and Quora still brings in millions of views daily.
Let?õ????s take a look at Quora?õ????s Alexa rank, though. (This is the worldwide rank.) You can see it
It is easy to see that, around the beginning of the year, Quora?õ????s rank really took a tumble. However, we can also see that, throughout most of 2016, the rank steadily increased. It appears to be doing the same thing now. From February to today, Quora?õ????s rank has only been improving, albeit very slowly.
Quora?õ????s rank was around 130 a year ago. Now it?õ????s around 140. Down by ten places after a year isn?õ????t great for Quora, but it?õ????s not too bad.

Counties don?õ????t cease to exist just because they are no longer administrative regions.
There are perhaps some exceptions. For example in Scotland, South Lanarkshire remains an administrative region but for administration purposes it no longer includes Glasgow. People from Glasgow, because it is a big city, do not think of themselves as being in South Lanarkshire, even though the full postal address says it is in South Lanarkshire (as it once was, administratively).

What does an unsupported and effective length of column mean?	"To decide a safe column size, it?õ????s length must be known.
The simplest and most obvious length is the unsupported length.
It is the length that is visible to you as you look at it and run your eye from the base of the column upwards till you see something (may be a beam) running horizotally at some floor level and framing into it.
So the unsupported length of the column is the actual physical length (or rather height) of the column between points of lateral support.
In the above figure the unsupported lengths of the column in the two orthogonal directions are Le1 and Le2.
But this length is only a starting input to determine the ?õ????effective length?õ????, which is the length that actually plays a part in deciding how much load it can carry. This depends on the unsupported length and further on the how the column is held or restrained at the ends. (Fixed against rotation? Allowed to sway laterally? fixed in position but allowed to rotate? etc) After considering these end conditions the unsupported length is multiplied by a factor to yield the so called ?õ????effective length?õ???? which ultimately decides the load carrying capacity.
The concept is something similar to ?õ????apparent capacity, or theoretical capacity?õ???? of something and the actual, effective, practical or realisable capacity of some plant/factory equipment etc.
Unsupported length is a dimension that is relevant to the fabricator or erector and can be measured with a tape.
Effective length is relevant to the engineer who does the calculations to arrive at an optimum size and cannot be measured with a tape.
I trust this is clear to non Civil engineers too. I have written this answer with them in mind.

My dad hung the phone and informed me about this. I was hopeful now as I thought that the police would be able to assist me in some way.
Disappointed and angry, I tried calling back the number myself and he again asked me how much I was willing to pay. This annoyed me further and I simply told him I wouldn?õ????t pay him a penny. I then told him I have already informed the police of this number and that he was free to do anything with my phone. Now, there was a change in his voice all of a sudden and was quite shaken. He then told me not to do any such thing and asked me to come to a main road and that he was willing to return the phone.
Since it was broad day light and it was a main road, I went with my dad and met the man. He turned out to be an auto driver. He handed over my phone and finally admitted to have stolen the device. He told me he had spent hours on it and realized it was of no use to him, since it remained locked with that

If you are willing to ride that learning curve, then by all means, make the jump.

Hackintosh is also an ugly crapshoot since unsupported hardware will blow up in unusual ways, but you?õ????ll get that with Linux, anyway.
The Mac is pleasant to use precisely because it is an OS carefully and meticulously tuned to run with a small subset of hardware. Linux is the exact opposite, with predictable results.

However, if your definition of the best requires good public transportation, then Sentosa Cove is definitely not in the list, as you definitely need a car to travel to and from home.

Why do special education teachers make more money?	"As the other answers have said, in most places in the US, they don't. Each district has a salary schedule which tells how much each teacher will make based on their years of experience and their level of education. This schedule is used for every teacher in the district, Kindergarten through high school, general ed and special ed. The difference in pay would be if perhaps more special ed teachers have higher degrees (I think it may sometimes be required of them). Teachers with a Masters degree make a few thousand dollars more than those with just a Bachelors.
The exception would be if a special ed opening is classified ?õ????hard to fill.?õ???ù This designation basically says that we can't get anyone to take this job, so we need to offer more than the typical salary. I'd assume that would be rare though, and they'd have to show that they could not get anyone at the base salary.
It would make sense for special ed teachers to make more, though. In addition to all of the duties of a regular ed teacher, lesson planning etc; they have piles of IEP paperwork, lifeskills lessons, assessments, and maybe things like assisting students in eating/bathrooming.

Do we know what causes autism?	"Evidence suggests that autisms (plural as their are likely several different etiologies) are a complex case of polygenic, epigenetic, prenatal, and environmental interactions.
Rather than having any simple origin there are many possible genetic and environmental predisposers which lead to autistic neurotypes when they come together.
This is much the same for many other conditions such as the exact form of ones eye and hair color, complete blood type, and predisposition toward cancer or heart disease.

Do you believe that the UK parliament would vote in favour of remaining inside the single market (European Economic Area)?	"Depends what strings were attached to it. The single market implies acceptance of the EU?õ????s Four Freedoms, which includes Freedom of Movement, and that might be a big sticking point because for some reason it?õ????s very unpopular. Also, if there are disputes in the single market, they?õ????re arbitrated by the European Court of Justice, and that?õ????s also very unpopular.
We could probably exit with a deal that kept us in the single market, with Freedom of Movement, ECJ jurisdiction, and still paying dues to the EU, but without any direct democratic say in how the EU is run. Would Parliament vote for that? Well, if it was that or crashing out into WTO rules, then maybe. Or maybe they?õ????d regard it as a humiliating defeat in negotiations, given that Leave was fought on immigration, sovereignty, and getting that money back.
The smart thing to do would be to say ?õ????OK, maybe let?õ????s not?õ????, but it?õ????s not really looking that great right now.

What are some artists that have a similar style to Kate Bush?	"I?õ????m sure people will respond here with answers such as Tori Amos, but if we are honest there really is nobody like Kate Bush. She is a true original talent with her own vision and personality. Sure she has influenced many female artists over the years, but they are all pale immitations, regardless of how successful they may be seen to be. Tori Amos is pretty much her own artist as well, but I would not regard her as being like Kate Bush. They both sing and play piano, and both are songwriters but after that they are very different to each other indeed.
Success should not be solely measured in money terms, because usually music that has sold well is often empty, moronic, vugar noise to entertain the masses. Happily Kate Bush is a gloriously vibrant, experimental, intelligent, brave artist who has shunned the limelight, and stayed away from the vacuous celebrity hamster wheel that is show business.

What will be RCB's lineup for IPL 2017?	"I think without virat Kohli and K L Rahul the probable batting lineup will be
The reason for giving kedar Jadav the role wicketkeeper is of the 51 IPL matches played by Kedar Jadhav, only 28 have been as a specialist batsman. In 23 other matches, apart from taking up a batting slot, Jadhav has also fulfilled the role of a wicket-keeper. He has 11 catches and four stumpings to his credit.
In the past RCB has played K L Rahul as a makeshift wicket keeper and use of Kedar Jadav as wicketkeeper gives them much needed bowling options . The purchase of pawan negi can turn out to be good move for them . Also anyone of Sarfaraz khan and Sachin baby can play the role of finisher lower down the order .

Why do so few British residents in Spain speak Spanish?	"I have a friend of British origin who was born in Spain and grew up with Spaniards. His parents do not speak Spanish though. He will be turning 27 this year and his parents have been here since then.
I used to work in an Irish pub in a coastal town located in Southern Spain. The doorman and I were the only Spaniards who worked there. The rest of the staff were mostly British and a few Irish. My ex-bosses were Irish.
The majority of the British immigrants come to Spain just because of our good weather and cheap alcohol. It is a good retirement place and I get that elder people don't need to learn the language to make a living. However, many British families come every year and most of them do not assimilate into the culture just because they are not interested.
They stay in their own bubble. They work in companies run by British/Irish or open their own. Some of them work at home. Many of them send their kids to British or international schools. So their kids end up hanging out with mostly British kids.
I think it's a shame.
Not everyone is like that though. Some do make an effort.

Would Margaret Thatcher have supported Brexit?	"This Maggie?
Or this one?
When there was a refendum before she campained for IN.
The whole time she was in office, she never said that Britain should leave.
She argued about terms, but mostly she argued about money - and she won.
Remember, she was the PM who negotiated and forced through the Single Europe Act on in 1986 (in the face of Euro-sceptic opposition).
That is one of the most pro-European pieces of legislation ever, at least as significant as 1973 (which she also supported) anhjd was a major shift in from EEC as a common market to EU as a political entity. And she championed that shift.
In the 1980s was the argument between ?õ????wider?õ???ù and ?õ????deeper?õ???ù - and Maggie was one of the key players in ?õ????wider?õ???ù which led to the huge increase in EU membership. And she was well aware they were poorer and that they could come to UK
Once she had left office she never commented publicly - even when it was tearing the Major government apart.
She could have put the boot in on the people who deposed her by supporting the ?õ????bastards?õ???ù (and it must have been very tempting to do so) - but she never did.
That strongly suggests she agreed with Major and not the euro-sceptics.
That is backed by the opinion of her closest lieutenant
MARGARET THATCHER?õ????S closest adviser has made a dramatic intervention in the debate on Europe, declaring that the former prime minister would have backed David Cameron?õ????s new deal with Brussels.
Lord Powell, the linchpin of her inner circle in Downing Street, insisted she would have put aside her emotional Euroscepticism to renegotiate the UK?õ????s relationship with the EU in the same way as Cameron.
Powell said Thatcher might have ?õ????raged more mightily?õ???ù at Brussels than Cameron. But, writing in The Sunday Times, he said: ?õ????She would have gone along with what is on offer, indeed negotiated something similar herself.?õ???ù
Maggie was very much a pragmatist, and very much pro-business.
And for all that I would critisize her she would have had no truck with the covert racism of UKIP.
She had problems with Europe: mostly about how much we should pay, but there is no evidence she wanted us to leave. Indeed, absolutely the reverse.
She had no issues with freedom of movement during the time she was in power, so I can?õ????t see that as problem either. Indeed, she would glory in the way that immigrants choose to come to UK and how our liberal working rules make it easy for them, in contrast to the schletrotic rules in other countries: far from that being a reason for out she would see it a success and a vindication of her policies.
I can?õ????t believe she would damage UK and damage Britain?õ????s industry, in opposition to all the business leaders, on an ideological belief in sovereignty.

Do atheists conclude that there is no God only after experiencing hardships in life or trauma?	"I like this question, because it gives us a chance to examine two contradictory memes in Christian circles ?õ???? and just to be safe, I?õ????ll narrow that down to contemporary American (and most often, evangelical) Christian circles, because I don?õ????t know from personal experience how prevalent these memes are in other traditions/places/times. Anyway, here they are:
The first meme is usually extrapolated beyond the literal meaning to apply to any case of extreme hardship. The idea is that the stress of such a situation brings out someone?õ????s underlying, innate belief in God. I think this idea persists, despite
The second, of course, is almost a direct contradiction. Which is it, does hardship drive people toward or away from faith? I think we all know the answer to that: it depends on the person and the situation, and one, the other, or neither of them could actually occur. But that is exactly what makes both of these memes dumb when taken as general rules.
To answer the OP?õ????s question more directly, though: it?õ????s inevitable that some people will indeed have become atheists following a traumatic experience, but my sense is that it?õ????s not very common. The vast majority of personal atheist testimonies I?õ????ve seen and heard have followed a similar theme: the person is bothered by some internal inconsistency in the religion and/or teachings that conflict with the person?õ????s own moral sense, the person begins to question some aspects of their faith, then starts to look at it more critically overall, and eventually loses faith in steps as their courage and certainty grows (sometimes very quickly, sometimes over the course of years). Often there can be something that sparks this process, but as I said it isn?õ????t that often a traumatic experience, but more commonly just noticing and being bothered by something about the religion itself that doesn?õ????t seem right to them.
Once again, no story is universal, but there is one thing about deconverted atheists that is probably as close as it gets to universal: those of us who write about it and defend it online have nearly all undergone a process of intense, informal study of the arguments, talking points, apologetics, etc related to belief and atheism. So yes, we do know your theology considers everybody a sinner, and we have heard the good news. No, Pascal?õ????s wager is not a good argument. Yes we have heard of CS Lewis?õ???? trilemma. No, we still don?õ????t think the problem of evil has been adequately ?õ????solved?õ???ù. Yes, we have considered the cosmological argument, even the Kalam. Heck, we might even be more well-versed in certain parts of the Bible than you are. Just keep that in mind when you?õ????re asking Quora questions or composing a snide comment.

Why did you choose to become a vegan or a vegetarian?	"The factory farming industry strives to maximize output while minimizing costs?õ????always at the animals?õ???? expense. The giant corporations that run most factory farms have found that they can make more money by squeezing as many animals as possible into tiny spaces, even though many of the animals die from disease or infection.
Animals on factory farms endure constant fear and torment:
When they?õ????ve grown large enough to slaughter or their bodies have been worn out from producing milk or eggs, animals raised for food are crowded onto trucks and transported for miles through all weather extremes, typically without food or water. At the slaughterhouse, those who survived the transport will have their throats slit, often while they?õ????re still conscious. Many remain conscious when they?õ????re plunged into the scalding-hot water of the defeathering or hair-removal tanks or while their bodies are being skinned or hacked apart.
Heart disease is the number one health problem in the United States today, and according to the American Heart Association, it is the single leading cause of death. Most heart disease is diet-related?õ????caused by diets high in animal products.
Here?õ????s the good news: Now that we know what heightens the risk of heart attacks, we can take steps to prevent them. Studies have shown that a healthy vegan diet?õ????rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables?õ????can stop and even reverse heart disease. People following a plant-based diet have 2.5 times fewer cardiac events, including heart attacks, strokes, bypass surgery, and angioplasty.
Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, one of the world?õ????s most respected nutrition experts, has been able to make patients who were suffering from clogged arteries virtually ?õ????heart-attack proof?õ???ù by putting them on healthy vegetarian diets and getting their cholesterol levels down below 150. The average vegan cholesterol level is about 146, while the average vegetarian cholesterol level is 177. And the average meat-eater?õ????s cholesterol level is 194. Another nutritionist, Dr. Charles Attwood, points out just how strange it is that more is not done in light of this information: If people were being run down by trucks at the same rate that they?õ????re dying from heart attacks induced by diets high in meat, eggs, and dairy products, drastic steps would be taken.
William Castelli, M.D., director of the Framingham Heart Study, the longest-running clinical study in medical history, says of the heart disease epidemic, ?õ????If Americans adopted a vegetarian diet, the whole thing would disappear.?õ???ù Castelli told PBS that Americans have been ?õ????brainwashed to eat meat.?õ???ù

I took my daughter (8) spelunking and now she won't come out of her room. What should I do?	"Oh, man. I really hope this is a joke?
You took your eight year old child spelunking when you were drunk? You put her in a confined space with grown men you denote as drinking buddies, underground, doing a dangerous activity, while you were mentally compromised? You thought this was an appropriate activity? You thought it warranted missing school? You thought this was safe, in any way, shape, or form?
Or did you not think? Did YOU want to do it, and think it would be funny, and simply take her along?
Do you know that your child is a human being, not an accessory or a prop or sidekick?
Let?õ????s do a thought experiment. Imagine a drunk male stranger came up to you and told you he wanted to take your daughter out of school, and lower her into a hole where she could not escape, and teach her what terror is.
The only appropriate response would be to beat the living sh#t out of him?õ????or have him locked up by authorities.
You do not get to treat your daughter worse than some abusive stranger. In fact, you must treat her far better.
First off?õ????-talk to your daughter. Ask her what she is afraid of. Ask her to verbalize what happened or what she experienced underground. Help her take the fears out of her head by giving voice to them. Apologize to her for frightening her, and tell her you messed up royally as a parent, since your literal primary job is to make her feel safe.
Then get some help?õ????therapy possibly, maybe alcohol dependency, definitely some parenting instruction.
Right now, your daughter is right. What she saw underground wasn't just a mask, but the fact that her father couldn?õ????t or wouldn?õ????t protect her. She will not feel safe until she unlearns this.
You messed up big time. Full stop. Luckily, people are defined not by how they screw up but by whether they choose to grow. I hope for both your sake and your daughter?õ????s that you do.

Why is Quora down on Trump (keep it up and I will unsubscribe)?	"I will remain ?õ????down on Trump?õ???ù whether or not you choose to unsubscribe.
After watching this man demean each of his opponents in the debates during the primaries, creating massive lies and revealing dangerous and careless behaviors and positions, and then do the same sort of thing to his Democratic opponent, I felt a switch turn on: this insulting and bloviating bully does not deserve the respect that most of the presidents of my life, whichever party they represented, have merited.
I never once voted for Bill Clinton, for instance, even when a resident of Arkansas, but Clinton had a respect for George H. W. Bush, the man he defeated in 1992, that continues to this day. Trump, on the other hand, seems to lack a modicum of respect for any person outside his family circle, insulting everyone from Angela Merkel to Meryl Streep to a disabled reporter. To those of us who wished that his bullying would end once he was installed in the presidency, the reality has been far from that. He thinks nothing of maligning judges, John McCain, a professional football player, the New York Times, or even the person who tried to replace him on Celebrity Apprentice.
For those of us who have rejected Trump, the obvious defects in his personality make it highly unlikely that we will extend any grace his way anytime soon. As for your decision to unsubscribe or not, that is your issue, but do not expect this forum to become an extension of Fox News; it isn?õ????t constructed that way.

Disable or remove browser extensions and toolbars you don't really need:
Run a hard drive check, says Silverman. He recommends installing a program called
Shut 'em down. For Macs, Windows 10, Windows 7 and eariler versions of Windows, you can close the programs from the file menu. In Windows 8, programs are built so that they run in the background for a while, then
Bookmark those ?õ????necessary?õ???ù links (for organization's sake, in a Bookmarks folder titled ?õ????To Read?õ???ù) and shut those tabs down. Even better,

For both, click the ?õ????CPU?õ???ù tab to order the programs by how much processing power they're taking up. If a program that you're not actively using is still up there in the top few programs, you can select to quit the process.
And, when it comes to browsers, Internet Explorer is especially heavy on your computer, Silverman says. ?õ????You don't have to run it but don't remove it [if you got it bundled with your Windows PC] ?õ???? it could cause problems as it's very tied to the operating system,?õ???ù he says. Instead, he suggests the lighter, more secure Chrome.
Head into your antivirus settings and configure it to scan late at night when you aren't using the computer, says Silverman. (However, that feature may not be available on some free antivirus programs ?õ???? which makes a good case for upgrading.)
Run a malware scan. ?õ????The best free one we like is Avast,?õ???ù Silverman says. For more free and paid options, check out our

System backups and restore points also can take up a huge amount of space, so don?õ????t keep more backup versions than you really need.
Sometimes the problem is not internal but external ?õ???? is the back of your CPU casing matted over with dust?

"Since the American government displays the fasces so prominently in joint assemblies, can anyone deny that the empire is an instrument of fascism?"	"The Fasces and Swastika were both ancient symbols that were appropriated by the Fascists and Nazis respectively. Today, someone could set up a hate-group and appropriate a cross as a symbol, or Pepe the frog, or the pyramids. But that wouldn?õ????t mean that, overnight, everyone who had used those symbols in the past would become part of the hate-group in question. ?õ????Fascism?õ???ù is not the use of a particular symbol, it is a set of policies and a form of government. If you are going to make out a case that the American government is an instrument of fascism, you need a different kind of evidence.

"Which field earns a lot of money, law, engineering, or the fine arts?"	"For engineering, really depends on the discipline and where you live.
Petroleum Engineering has a lot of demand but only in certain places and has great pay. But in general, as long as you avoid Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering you shouldn?õ????t have an issue to find a job and have a good job. Electrical Engineering might seem good, but advances in hardware are made by research in Chemestry and Physics and a lot less in design. This is because it would be very expensive for companies to change the current computer architecture in use (x86) to a better design. Personally, I went in Software Engineering because there?õ????s always need for them and, it is a very lucrative market.
Law earns a lot of money, but takes a long time to become a lawyer due to general requirements and if you want to make a lot of money, you?õ????ll have to move to areas where most of your income goes into living costs.
Fine arts is a consistent pay but mostly regarded as a joke by other faculties. If you?õ????re talented, you can earn a lot of money in the fine arts.

Is India the only country that has a censor board which cuts scenes in movies?	"Ever seen this in front of a movie trailer?
Its not India alone. Every country has their own censor boards through which films should pass before they are deemed certified to be screened for a broad nationwide audience in movie theaters.
This is largely because unlike the internet, movie theaters are not really places with complete freedom of expression. In the internet, pretty much anything goes (although off late, restrictions have started becoming commonplace over the internet too regarding certain issues). Because movies in theaters will be seen by a large paying audience with all demographics, the censor board acts as a body that certifies how suitable the movie is to be shown across different age groups.
Every country has its own rating system. The Indian board (CBFC) has the below rating systems
Likewise, the US censor board (MPAA or Motion Pictures Association of America) has its own rating norms which are
Because movies have been around for a long time, it was necessary to put in place a system that rates them so as to prevent unsuitable material from sneaking into theaters. The ratings mainly suggest the age group that a movie is most suitable for, giving parents an idea of whether or not children can be taken to see the movie. With the influencing power of movies playing in theaters, at times, the rating system becomes necessary.
Normally, movies are passed with as few cuts as possible. However, most of the filmmakers strive to attain a rating that allows for a maximum reach while keeping their vision intact (which is mostly the U rating in India and PG or PG-13 rating in the US). It is here that the cuts become quite high for some films leading to discontent.
Its only in the last two decades that the internet has become a powerful medium of showing film related content (more so in the last decade after the finding of YouTube and the advent of HD video). Perhaps we may see some form of censor board certification for internet-only content in the near future as well.

What makes some people believe that grades measure intelligence?	"Thanks for the A2A
First off understand that knowledge is the accumulation of information, intelligence is the application of knowledge to solve an issue.
Now, once you have understand that then this of it this way, learning in school is the process of accumulation of knowledge, similar to how us observing the behavior of people/friends/family/strangers is also the accumulation of information hence knowledge. knowledge by itself is useless as just knowing something does not amount to anything.
Now, intelligence is as stated above when we apply knowledge and the way you gauge someones intelligence is by testing how well a person applies the knowledge in a controlled environment where everyone has the same amount of knowledge thus the better a person applied the knowledge the higher his grade and hence the higher his perceived intelligence.
While the method might be flawed by the fact that students may not pay attention in class (easily distracted students) while other might pay extra attention outside of class (self study) thus making a case where students do not have the same amount of knowledge prior to taking the exam thus making the grading a little flawed, one can also argue that in the real environment the same people who take extra time to study the problem compared to the one who is easily distracted would probably do the job better even though the other might just do a bad job BECAUSE his knowledge on the subject is less than the guy who studied but hey this is the real world and results matter more than effort if said effort amounts to nothing.
Again you could make the argument that some people finds it harder to absorb knowledge in the form of books or perhaps hard to interpret technical works thus giving those who finds it easier an edge in the knowledge gathering department but again i could argue back that the intepretion of technical works is reliant on our understanding and application of previous technical works thus if you remember what you learn previously and try to relate it then the whole chapter would seem easier compared to you going at it blind which again falls back to intelligence as you would need to apply what you have learnt when trying to relate one to the other.
In short, while grades as a means to measure intelligence is slightly flawed, the fact remains that the ability for the child to realize his responsibility to study, manage his time, and ultimately do well in the exams is a good way to measure how intelligence,

What is the best way to keep your feet dry?		
Can a sword be carried around as a self-defence weapon?	"Utterly, totally, and completely depends on where you are.
Country, subdivision, and in some cases even the city or town, makes a huge difference. Laws are different everywhere.
In most places a sword is probably not going to be allowed.
In the US, there is no federal law on swords, so it falls to individual states.
In my home state of Minnesota the law on swords is a bit thin. All we really have is this:
Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 625, Section 625.16
Whoever shall go armed with a dirk, dagger, sword, pistol, or other offensive and dangerous weapon, without reasonable cause to fear an assault or other injury or violence to person, family, or property, may, on complaint of any other person having reasonable cause to fear an injury or breach of the peace, be required to find sureties for keeping the peace, for a term not exceeding six months, with the right of appealing as before provided.
and this:
Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 624, Section 624.61
It shall not be lawful for any body of persons, other than the National Guard, troops of the United States and, with the consent of the governor, sons and daughters of veterans and cadets of educational institutions where military science is taught, to associate themselves together as a military company with arms, but members of social and benevolent organizations are not prohibited from wearing swords. Any violation of this section shall be a misdemeanor.
So, basically, it is legal to carry a sword so long as you are by yourself and not marching in formation, and you don?õ????t scare anyone with it.
However, many cities and towns in Minnesota, especially the larger ones, have ordinances about blade length that is allowed in public.
Even if the town you are in doesn?õ????t have such a regulation, you can expect to invite police attention. A person walking down the street with a sword in 2017 is going to stick out like a sore thumb, and they are drawn to the unusual.

How much can a dress code tell you about a company?	"Very little as most places have the standard black dress and blazer and/or big black belt for women, and men must wear black pants with a tidy dark shirt.
Take GOOGLE for example.
Employees wear casual clothes like this
Their work environment is super casual and fun, but that most definitely is not a negative reflection of the company. Google is still a powerful and successful company that works hard and is always improving. Looking at their workers you would think they were laid-back and did nothing but lay around.
These people look pretty serious. They might work at a finance or accounting firm and never talk to one another unless it?õ????s work related. They probably are all really boring and mean.
Or they are super wild, fun and friendly people and their work environment is super positive and fun. The company is also really laid-back and chill. But just looking at their clothes in a serious environment wouldn?õ????t tell you that.
In short, clothing will tell you little to nothing about a company. Instead if you wanted to learn about a company, focus on the interactions of their staff and HRs.

What is the best FPS gaming mouse?	"I would recommend
The body of the mouse is made completely of oddly shaped plastics cut in various polygonal shapes. While the mouse is plastic, it's none of that cheap, bendy stuff. This is serious, high-grade plastic in various finishes to aid in grip. Matte is on the top and back, in between are strips of glossy plastic, at the sides are rubberized plastic with a moulded triangle pattern. The black and grey are accented with streaks of electric blue on the thumb rest and on the lit up G and DPI indicators.
Apart from the usual left and right buttons, there are two on the side of the left mouse button, possibly for quick weapon switching. Then there are the Back and Forward buttons on the left hand side of the mouse within easy reach for your thumb. On the same side is also a Thumb Trigger button for quick DPI shift or additional button mapping in a function shift.
Up top, above the mouse wheel, there are three buttons. One is a toggle that frees your mouse wheel (more on that later). The other two are DPI up and down buttons, both at different angles so you can feel them out easily.
The underside of the mouse retains that triangle motif as well as the blue colour. The PTFT mouse-feet, instead of being at the four ends of the mouse, surround the sensor housing in an odd way, and in large chunks. This is mostly to aid the sensor in its all-surface features.
Around the sensor is the housing for the weights, which is secured in place by a magnetic cover. Open it and you'll see the odd pentagonal weight placement pattern. There's an ergonomic reason for this. The weights are cut in an arrow pattern, and you can place them in anywhere around that pentagon. Everyone's wrist is different, especially in the weight it exerts when using a mouse, so to negate lift on the left side, you can just anchor that side down with a weight to bring balance to the mouse, thus reducing strain.
The mouse is very comfortable to use for those with medium-sized hands.

"What real moral or ethical dilemma have you faced in life, and how did you resolve it?"	"When I was 25, my first job in Boston was working for a non-profit that was opening a homeless shelter for adolescent girls. The girls were in transition from protective services and the department of youth services and were either going back home or into a longer residential facility.
I was hired around the time the shelter opened and a small team of us were getting the girls' bedrooms ready- painting dressers, ordering blankets, pillows, and buying dishes for the kitchen. We were really excited to make it as homey as possible and a month later, the girls started to get placed into the rooms.
The job was difficult in that, the girls were difficult. Behaviorally, there were issues with them- acting out, using drugs, and sometimes getting in fights with each other. I was hired to do the overnight shift.
The agency owned and operated another program for girls in the upper floors of the same house. Occasionally we would have a cigarette break and talk to the staff or other girls up there and that's when we started to hear about many problems.
The girls began confiding in us that one of the overnight staff members had her boyfriend over and was receiving oral sex from the girls. Keep in mind, these are teenage girls who have a history of sexual abuse.
One of those girls ended up in the hospital after a suicide attempt. This was just the beginning of a slew of violations and incidents that occurred that summer.
In our house, our directors were sending kids home for the weekend and some were coming back beat up. Girls tried to run away. There was a host of problems.
One of my co-workers went to the top Executive Director to tell her about the problems. It was mandated by the state to report these incidences but the director refused to do it. She said that there was no reason to report them because they were just going to do what the state would ask them to do anyway.
When my co-worker pressed the issue with the director, she was promptly fired.
Then it was up to me.
I kept my mouth shut for another 4-6 weeks and just began writing down everything and the list of violations grew. One of them had to do with my bosses showing me a bottle of Jack Daniels in the house that she kept in her desk as she mentioned, ""Needing this badly."" She thought it was funny. I smiled and wrote it down on my list.
By the time I left the job, I had a list of 26 violations that were perpetrated by the shelter and the organization - both upstairs and downstairs. I quit. Called the Office for Children and told them that I had a healthy list to report.
They took down everything.
Not long after, they conducted an investigation into not only my shelter but a few others. Three of them were shut down.
That was the summer I learned about taking responsibility for others' lives- particularly in the counseling field, which I was just about to embark into. I'll never forget that summer of hell and will always remember those girls and the pain they felt from being abused and mishandled by people who were supposed to help.

Humans have always been fascinated with the thought that the universe somehow reflects us.
Moreover, Our human brains grow in very interesting ways; by connecting clusters of brain cells to each other using neurons as pathways. The electrical firing and linking by these pockets keeps expanding and connecting in order to form a massive complex network, very much like the internet.
The original study puts it this way: we show that the causal network representing the large-scale structure of spacetime in our accelerating universe is a power-law graph with strong clustering, similar to many complex networks such as the internet, social, or biological networks. We prove that this structural similarity is a consequence of the asymptotic equivalence between the large-scale growth dynamics of complex networks and causal networks.
Science has always been suggesting that consciousness might be the underlying fabric of the universe and that it spawns everything. M-theory, Unified Field Theory, and String Theory are all based on that idea. The ?õ????

Why won't my 4 year old niece talk in her class or respond to teachers?	"Google ?õ????selective mutism?õ???ù, it might be what she has. My son went through this when he was 2?õ????3. He would be terrified to speak to teachers, cashiers at the store, strangers, anyone except family or close friends. (Although in his case, he did listen to them and would respond non-verbally, nodding or shaking his head or gesturing.) In his first class of nursery school, by the end of the year he was finally talking to his teachers one on one but still hated circle time and speaking in groups. If there was ever a substitute in the room, he would clam up. His teacher for the next year had a different approach and was much more nonchalant about it. If he didn?õ????t want to talk she didn?õ????t press the issue and he soon warmed up to her. In transitional kindergarten the following year, he was a whole new kid, outgoing, confident and talkative to his friends. He went to speech therapy that year, mainly for articulation of his ?õ????r?õ???ù, ?õ????l?õ???ù and ?õ????th?õ???ù sounds. When his pronunciation improved, so did his confidence.
This summer he finished speech therapy (can correctly articulate all of his sounds now!) and we moved to a new town. He started kindergarten and you would never know he had ever been ?õ????shy?õ???ù or would refuse to talk. He speaks confidently in class and he?õ????s become a leader to his friends, the first guy to shout out an idea when they?õ????re thinking of what to play, etc.
So hang in there, I hope your niece will outgrow this. But speech therapy will help, if you can get it (we had to pay for private speech ourselves since the school district did not think our son?õ????s issues were affecting his learning experience since he could still be understood.) Also having one on one playdates with other kids besides her close friends, so she gets more comfortable around other people in the class could help.

"Do you think India should follow presidential form of government to rise above caste-based and communal politics, which we presently notice?"	"There is presidential form of government in the countries in blue and yellow.
All these countries have problems such as racism, religious intolerance, class divisions and all other problems like any other republican form of government. There is no evidence to show that presidential forms rise above caste and communal politics.
No. Beyond wishful thinking, there is no relationship between the two.

Can my money be stolen from my bank account if I have no card?	"Unfortunately, this kind of thing is all too common. Once criminals get ahold of personal information like a social security number and a bank account number, theft becomes far too easy. This can happen in many forms. People can go to a branch where you aren?õ????t particularly known and use a fake ID to withdraw money from your account, they can setup ACH payments that are debited directly from your account. Perhaps even the worst form of fraud is when someone writes a fake or stolen check and cashes it off of your account. It then can come back on your account. And the list goes on. There are many ways that banks try to prevent all of these things from happening, but the simple matter is, banks lose thousands of dollars every week to fraud. The best policy is to monitor your accounts. Keep an eye on the activity in them. If you see anything suspicious, report it immediately.

Why can atheists not accept the evidence that Jesus is the son of God?	"Firstly, you are missing a big step here - why can we not accept that Jesus is the son of God. Three key words: Son of God.
This is the point you are going to lose most atheists like myself.
Jesus is fine - There?õ????s a grain of truth in many myths, and Jesus is likely a genuine historical figure, or at least based on one (or a conglomeration of several). Given his reputation, I would think he was a Gandhi/Aesop type figure with messages and stories that conveyed them.
BUT, was he the son of God? Well, setting aside the idea that extraordinary claims (like omnipotent, omniscient deities) need extraordinary evidence, which is something that others have already covered well here - Let me just describe how this sounds to a lifelong atheist who was not raised in a religious environment:

What are the biggest lies that society tells us?	"Society needs to travel the world, and learn something. Actually, our sources tell us it has been travelling the world but still hasn?õ????t learnt anything. What does it do instead? When the ?õ????moral fabric?õ???? of the nation is in tatters, blame the winds coming from the West. From cell phones to skirts to noodles to rock music to English language to pub culture ?õ???? just about any home grown evil can be baselessly contained in the lie that western influence is changing our today and ruining our tomorrow. (Different matter altogether that Mrs. Morality felt free enough to wear pants and tank-tops when in the West herself!) Society needs a make-over, and fast. Now, who?õ????s volunteering?
If you are a parent already, you know what I mean. If you are not, this might drive you away from becoming one! Soon as your baby arrives, Society walks in like a doctor and pours into your brain myths and superstitions that are silly to say the least. Pure lies, as it passes on these vagaries as wisdom for your well-being. Do not see the lines on their hands till they are 12 or they will not be successful, do not throw a baby?õ????s leftovers down the drain or he will fall ill, don?õ????t eat greens when breast-feeding or your baby?õ????s skin will turn green and do not share the room with your husband till your child is 10 years old. Ok. We exaggerate the last one a wee bit! But then, what?õ????s a teeny bit of hyperbole on our part when a million such nonsensical lies are doing their rounds as truths to be feared and hence followed?
We wouldn?õ????t know, do you? If Society had its way, it would want to live and die with the Virginal stamp, so over-rated is the concept of virginity and women. It?õ????s a lie! Virginity is not Godliness and neither can it make you feel like a God. If in doubt, ask the Gods themselves. The idea is just another means of writing character certificates for women, or denying them ?õ???? ignoring all biological basis for the loss of one. Only cleanliness is next to godliness, or so we think!
Degrees are important, but they are not all, as Society makes it out to be. What makes or mars a man is not the formal education that he acquired, but also the parenting he received at home, professional experience he gained at work, the kind of friends who kept him company and the pick-up line he used last without any success (OK. Not so much the last bit, I agree!) And then, at the extreme end of the
You know what we are talking about. So your marriage did not get made in heaven and you need a matrimonial advert. Fine! But pray tell us, dear Society, why such venom you carry against those who are short, wheatish and educated from schools other than convents? Tch tch! This ?õ????printed fact?õ???ù that a tall, fair and convent-educated girl is a better match for your nincompoop son is not just a baseless lie, it is making fairness cream
A fabrication, this idea that religion is one?õ????s ?õ????dharma?õ????. Religion is not mean ?õ????dharma?õ????, duty does. Duty towards every other human being, no matter what class, caste or faith. Duty to do good and be good, and not consider your religion above all the others and or before the idea of humanity. We may not have read our sacred texts cover-to-cover, really, but what we do know is that forwarding the idea of religion as the foremost and purest basis of identity is a lie society indulges in, ending up doing more harm than good and creating divisiveness where none need exist.
This is as sexist as sexist gets. Society is wrong when it gives us examples from times immemorial to establish the lie that women are physically and emotionally suited to take care of the household and the men to work and earn. This age-old lie is so ingrained in the female psyche that it is making some of believe in it as if it were scientific and true. While we will say ?õ????wake-up!?õ???? to the unassuming subservient women, we will say ?õ????silence!?õ???? to that part of society which is perpetuating an unequal environment by propagating such self-serving lies.

How much money did immigrants coming through Ellis Island (19th Cent.) need to have?	"My family didn't come over at that time and as far as I know (from the mormans who have the most extensive records In the world as far as family history and ones pedegree) my family has been in America since 1789 and I think one of my grandmothers distant relatives came over in that time frame but not through Ellis. I do know some of what it's like to come from a different place from family history though. My paternal (Hudspeth)side came from northern England in 1789. Imagine going to a country that has just been founded and was dangerous as hell. Than you have to liqidate your assets at a loss, (The family has been around since Saxon times and were quite comfortable in protestant England) then take a perilous journey across the Atlantic that took a substantial amount of time as they were under sail, then when you get here in one piece and alive try to find a business that's going to succeed and buy land or choose to settle it for themselves. A dangerous undertaking at best and financially risky. They became slave holders first, settleling in what's now Hudspeth County in Southern Texas, when slavery was banned most of the slaves took our name and continued to work for us, some until the 1960s. We had gone Into the pharmacy buisness in Texas and Oklahoma and sold out in the 60s
I still keep in contact with some Hudspeths of African decent that still live in Texas one is in her 90s now and I learned some oral family history from her the most important thing being why they took our name.
Coming to America through Ellis island or anywhere else was a dangerous undertaking at best. Just like any other time the more money you have the better off you going to be. Some people came with nothing in steerage on a steamship with the clothes on their back and not speaking English and became successful after alot of hard work and risk. I love this country and wouldn't want to move anywhere else. Not back to England. The food sucks.

"Do you agree that what one hates about other people is actually innate in him/herself, and that who they hate is a reflection of themselves?"	"I wouldn?õ????t say it that way, I think that?õ????s confusing and imprecise.
The way to understand this is to think in terms of ?õ????self vs. Other?õ???ù, where both ?õ????self?õ???ù and ?õ????Other?õ???ù are abstractions. (An abstraction is a general category that can have many specific forms).
Because of the way thought and language work, the mind ?õ????splits reality up?õ???ù into various forms of opposites. This is called ?õ????discrimination?õ???ù, you can think of it sort of like the different ways that an orange can be split into opposing halves.
So there?õ????s a whole raft of ?õ????discriminative opposites?õ???ù that are produced by our use of concepts in thought and language. ?õ????Self vs. Other?õ???ù is one of the most fundamental and important dualisms that arise when we?õ????re talking about life and self-expression and truth and the meaning of things on a human scale.
Why is this important? Because your beliefs about ?õ????what sort of person you are?õ???ù tend to be the focal point of your mind?õ????s survival machinery ?õ???? your mind will distort reality in ways which are heavily influenced by your beliefs about who you are, and those beliefs are correlated with a kind of photographic negative or ?õ????opposing Other?õ???ù.
For example, someone who is intensely conservative politically will be very quick to detect signals of ?õ????liberal thinking?õ???ù as the Other ?õ???? possibly the enemy. If you walk past them and wink in a liberal way, they?õ????ll get a little burst of defensiveness, because you have signalled Otherness.
Self-and-Other are both abstract, we all have many ways of recognizing what is self and what is Other, it?õ????s context-dependent. But the pattern is universal?õ???? we try to keep the Other at arm?õ????s length. Sometimes the Other is a person or group, sometimes it?õ????s a feeling, sometimes it?õ????s some belief about ourselves even! Whatever you oppose, whatever you fear, whatever you are suspicious of, whatever you wish you could have but can?õ????t get?õ???? it?õ????s all the Other.
And ?õ????you?õ???ù ?õ???? as in your self-definition ?õ???? tends to match the Other like a cookie and the dough it was cut from. The Other is ?õ????that which I am not.?õ???ù
So the maintenance of your identity ?õ???? which is a high priority psychologically ?õ???? often rests on ?õ????pushing against the Other?õ???ù?õ???? i.e. you feel like you know who you are more concretely when you?õ????re really angry at the Other, for example. Sharpening the distinction between self-and-Other is an ancient strategy for making the self feel more real. It shows up in individual thinking as well as group thinking (quick: what does Donald Trump do to rally the troops? Scold the Other, of course!)
If someone becomes interested in awakening from all of this (which is a form of ?õ????endarkenment?õ???ù, certainly), then it makes sense to pay attention to the Other and ask ?õ????how does this define who I think I am??õ???? Learning to be aware of the Other as an abstract stereotype rather than a specific ?õ????real?õ???ù entity is useful, because it helps you to see how you?õ????re clinging to a false identity for security, instead of letting go and listening for the more complete ?õ????true self?õ???ù perspective.

In the end, you still don?õ????t have the consistent income in order to live the six-figure income lifestyle, and if you are asking for $100,000 I think it?õ????s safe to say you?õ????re not a Warren Buffett just quite yet.

"Indian forest service is one among the three all India services such as IAS, IPS.?ˇ But the only difference is that this exam is conducted on a different date and the syllabus for the mains exam is different from that of the civil service exam. To become a forest service officer one needs a detailed study about different flora and fauna and the forest and wildlife protection acts. But on the civil service exam, this is not the case. There the candidate needs only a generalist view on every aspect, not a specialist view. That is another difference. Apart from all these differences, Indian Forest Service is also a part of the Indian civil service and enjoys all the benefits received by other services as well.

What was life like in the time period in which Luke's Gospel was written?	"It seems to have been written around the time of the destruction of the second Temple in AD70 by the Roman Army, so it was a very turbulent time. Christianity wasn't adopted as the official religion of Rome until at least two hundred years later, and until then Christians were liable to persecution by the Roman Empire. Luke's intended audience were not those Jews who had heard the news of Jesus from his original followers (who were obviously most affected by the destruction of the Temple) but the gentiles to whom the apostle Paul had begun to preach, in his wandering mission to set up church communities. Like the other apostles, and indeed Jesus, Paul was a Jew, and probably had no idea that a religion, separate from Judaism, would be formed. There was a great deal of wrangling between the early church leaders about whether gentiles should be expected to observe the Jewish laws e.g. by being circumsized. The fact that Paul, who argued that gentiles should not be so required, prevailed is probably one of the factors in Christianity splitting off from Judaism. That and the refusal of many Jews to accept that Jesus was the Messiah foretold by their scriptures. So the period was fraught with danger from the Roman Empire, and by disagreement amongst the church leaders. There would also have been the growing doubt that Jesus, whom the apostles believed would return in their own lifetimes, was actually going to appear and fulfill their predictions about the coming of the Kingdom of God.

What is the story of Navratri?	"Durga Puja is the worship of Durga in her various forms. Durga Puja is known by different names and Durga pooja is celebrated in different ways - Navaratri, Durga Ashtami, Maha Navami, Saraswati Puja, Dussehra, Ramleela , Akalbodhan and Vijayadashami.
A demon,Mahishasura performed penance with great dedication and he obtained the boon to not get killed either by man or God. Shiva granted the boon, which made the Asura arrogant and he wanted to rule the heaven. He created problems and unleashed a reign of terror. He initiated a further attack on heaven which made the Gods assemble for finding a remedy to get rid of the nuisance of Mahishasura.
A solution was found by creating Durga and amalgamating the powers of all the Male Gods. She tried to kill Mahishasura but he kept hiding by disguising himself for 8 days and on 9th day Durga was able to find him and slayed his head. This is the myth behind the Navaratri. Navaratri symbolizes the victory of knowledge over ignorance.

"If Narendra Modi suddenly removes reservations like demonitisation, what will happen in India?"	"It has been a very long time and have been looking to dig on to a question like this. Love your question because if you ask me , a third term Modi(2024?õ????2029) might do this. With RSS thoroughly behind removing reservations chances although slim but yet around to point out that this is a distinct possibility.
India is currently in the midst of Nationalism inspired Hindutva, where people are identifying themselves as Indians proudly. The left inspired intellect had made Nationalism look almost the act of those who knew nothing. However now it is okay to be a Nationalist and move beyond cricket flag waving.
Let me start with the history of reservations in India, post independence. Caste based reservations have been a part of the government even before 1947, however In 1954 reservations were introduced in educational institutes. The SC/ST and OBC based reservations got a boost with the VP Singh Government implementing the recommendations of the Mandal Commission (headed by BP Mandal and commission established by the Janta Party Gov in 1979). The Commission found that 54% of the total population with over 3700 castes are backward in India(currently 5103 castes are OBCs in India).
The total reservation in gov jobs are 50% and in Educational Institutes is 50%, however state of TN have 67% as reservation, Maharashtra till 2014 had additional 5% for Muslims and 5% for Marathas in Jobs under the state government.
RSS has always maintained that they are not against reservations but would like a timeframe under which they see it phased out. However in India it is political suicide if you state ?õ????Reservations need to go?õ???? apropos: BIHAR 2015 election results.
Reservations are a necessity to bring backward classes ahead in life, but the real beneficiaries have always been the more affluent and more educated backward classes. The extremely backward classes do not have the resources to reach even high school education and hence reservations real benefits haven't reached the one with whom probably it was meant to play an important role. However this isn't the biggest issue with reservations.
The biggest issue is the vote bank politics. With parties like RPI, BSP, RJD and JDU and other having made their political clout on backward castes.
If Modi, does and I assuming it shall be a phased reservation abolishment is when he will be at the end of his political career which seems like 2029. He shall with the consent of the ideologue RSS and studies based on the exploitation of reservations might bring the first level ban on reservations and seems like it will start with government jobs where they are anyways looking at more accountability.
It is likely that the real beneficiaries of reservation who are living in comfortable abodes shall get the ones who have never benefitted into rising against the government, there will be widespread protests but if Modi is able to deliver development then in all likelihood the protests will not be the scales one saw during pre Emergency imposition days or even the likes where they saw Anna Hazare reaching the pinnacle of his social career.
There will be confusion amongst the lower castes for sometime who have now consider reservations as their birth right and the ones who oppose it will be jubilant.
But along with the ban there has to be a clear roadmap for the government to work on it.

How can you keep your relationship fresh and interesting whether that be a long distance relationship or not?	"Q:
That?õ????s the sort of advice one reads about in
I am sorry, I have never once thought about how to keep my relationships fresh and interesting. They either are, because we have things to talk about and do together, or they are not because we have nothing in common, and then we don?õ????t even get beyond the first fumbling chat. This presumes that we are not just together because we have the hots for each other, but that we are a tad more discerning in our partner selection. Hormones are not very bright, letting them make the choices might not be the best idea.
If we are interesting people who read and think and communicate about the ideas we have, if we are curious what the other thinks about and dreams about, we don?õ????t have to struggle to find something to keep things fresh, they will simply be that way and keep being that way automatically. It?õ????s a matter of attitude; as long as one doesn?õ????t take the other person for granted and keeps in mind that we?õ????re all much like onions (there?õ????s always another layer), there will be new things to discover because life is ever-changing.
Boredom is for bores. And maybe for adrenaline junkies. I?õ????ve not yet run out of things to discuss with my LDR partner of 16 years. I can?õ????t imagine it happening, since we?õ????re both intensely curious about life, and never stop learning new things.

Why do I always feel like I am annoying someone every time I talk to them?	"If you?õ????re self conscious:
Do you apologise after every second sentence?
Do you apologise for taking up space?
Do you apologise for taking up their time?
Apologising all the time can be really annoying, turning your fear of being annoying into a self-fulfilling prophecy. Don?õ????t apologise for existing.
If you?õ????re the kind of person who apologises all the time, this comic is helpful in different ways to express yourself:
If you complain a lot:
Complaining a little is fine, it?õ????s okay for friends to share the things that are going on in their lives, including frustrating things, but it?õ????s important to remember to also share the fun things and good things. If every time I talk to someone I just know it?õ????s going to be about their crappy lives, what have I got to look forward to in their company?

If you infringe on people?õ????s me-time:
The great thing with digital media and mobile phones is that people can stay connected, the bad thing is that it can be hard for people to disconnect. Mobile phones can cause a lot of stress because people are expected to be contactable at all times which means people don?õ????t get opportunities to unwind. Sometimes I don?õ????t want to talk to someone but just read a book, or watch Netflix, or just listen to music, and if a friend is messaging me insisting on a conversation, it can be a bit annoying when I was wanting to just spend time in my own head. It?õ????s my responsibility to set boundaries and not let people think that I must and always will respond to them immediately under all circumstances, but not everyone is good at doing this politely and clearly. My suggestion is to make plans so that they can schedule spending time with you, and stick to the agreed scheduled times, and if you get the sense that you are annoying someone over digital media, then it might be time to leave them alone, not because they don?õ????t like you, but because they might just not want to socialise right then.
I don?õ????t know if you do any of these things and it could be your sense is just your own insecurity, or there may be other reasons, but these are things you can reflect on.

How is overall grade of each subject in 10th CBSE calculated?	"Well its is very complicated procedure
G.P of a subject is calaculated by performance in F.A?õ????s(Formative Assessment) and S.A?õ????s(Summative Assessment).
There are 4 F.A,s each of 50 marks then marks obtained out of 50 are divided by 5 ,so we get the marks out of 10.There are 4 F.A?õ????s so 10+10+10+10=40 so F.A?õ????s constitute 40 marks and then marks obtained in S.A?õ????s out of 90 are divide by 3, so that we can get marks out of 30 . There are 2 S.A?õ????s so 30+30=60 .S.A?õ????s constitutes 60 marks.
Then this total average of F.A?õ????s and S.A?õ????s are added i.e 40+60=100 so we get marks out of 100 then these marks out of hundred are divided by 10 and we get total out of 10 .This total out of 10 is called the G.P(Grade Point ) of a subject . Then the G.P?õ????s of all the subjects are added and the sum is divided by the no. of subject and the value which is obtained is called the C.G.P.A (Cummulative Grade Point Aggergate) of a student.

How should we prepare for GRE and TOE?	"GRE and TOEFL are the quint-essential exams to achieve your dreams of foreign studies. They are the exams that assess the qualities, skills and credibility of a student to prepare him to face the real world challenges.
TOEFL(Test Of English as a Foreign Language) is the test that is taken and accepted in majority of the countries. Every year Crores of students take their exam and tests their language skills required to start their journey in foreign universities.
This may contain 4 parts.
1.Reading(30 marks)
2.Listening(30 marks)
3.Speaking(30 marks)
4.Writing(30 marks)
The TOEFL test takes for 120 marks which 80?õ????90 is considered as a better score to get into the university. But if you want to gain prospects of world-class universities like Harvard and Stanford, you need to get 117?õ????120.
This is a simple online and offline based exam conducted across the world. ETS is the center which conducts the exam every year(one per week basis). The total fee is approximately RS 12,000/- INR
The preparation for one month is essential to crack 100 and above marks. You may also study on your own to get better insights about the exam . Reading The Hindu paper daily may equip you with the necessary skills (RLSW) to become an expert.
You may also take the online courses by EdX in association with TOEFL. This is free of cost and best to integrate your skills and test them by joining the discussion forums.

How exactly does a mind of a sociopath work?	"You can tell how their minds work by reading excerpts from interviews with them.
At Psychology Today there is an article with a list of quotes from actual criminals that displays in chilling detail why those with antisocial pd (or psychopathy or sociopathy) are to be avoided. (Link below).
The list of statements illustrates over and over the disturbingly inhuman mind-set of such individuals and their key characteristics, which include:
*lack of affective empathy
*lack of a conscience
*lack of remorse
*a sense of entitlement.

"Can I wear black suit two or three days in a row? (But different shirts, ties, and shoes)"	"That's exactly how I would change it up. Studies have been done where people have worn the exact same thing for days and weeks and their colleagues never noticed. I would just brush the jacket and pants and carefully press out any wrinkles, hang them up and you're good to go another day. With a black suit you can wear just about any shirt and tie combo (avoid a black shirt if you're dressing for the office). The tie needs to have some black in it to pull the outfit together. Maybe you could find a vest to wear under the jacket some of the time. V-neck sweaters or sweater vests give you lots of colorful options too. For shoes, I think black is best, tho you could get by with cordovan. I just can't break up my suit pieces but if this doesn't bother you, another pair of slacks and sports coat paired with your suit pieces is an easy and fairly inexpensive way to add variety. Good luck!

Do all Christians listen to Hillsong?	"No they definitely do not!

Why did God leave us for so long?	"I presume your question is about why there seems to have been a 2,000-year gap between the death of the Apostles (or the death of Muhammad, depending on your views about the prophet) and modern times during which God seems to have abandoned mankind, with no revelations or prophets.
The answer is that God works according to the faith of individuals. He does not intervene in the affairs of men to impose revelation on those who aren?õ????t seeking to know God. Thus, the darkness of the Dark Ages and the apostasy of the church as evidenced by the ?õ????doctrine-by-committee?õ???ù of the Nicene Creed and the transformation into the Roman Catholic Church into a political power more than a spiritual body of saints simply inspired more darkness, i.e. led to a culture that encouraged reliance on the iron-fisted human and political leaders of the chuch and suppressed individual study of the scriptures and personal prayer and seeking answers to questions from God.
The good news is that the heavens have been opened in these latter days when a 14-year old boy went into the woods to pray about which church to join. Latter-day prophets and apostles walk the earth today. We simply need eyes to see and ears to hear.

How do protons gather in the nucleus of an atom despite the expected repulsion they should exhibit?	"The repulsion you?õ????re talking about is electrostatic repulsion, which is indeed a very strong force compared to gravity. If you were to bring 2 protons together normally, you would experience increasing repulsion as a function of r^-2, where r is distance between protons (Coulombic force).
What if you mustered all your strength (metaphorically) and pushed the 2 protons as close as you could?
You would see the emergence of a new force
Strong nuclear force is a dominant force only at very short ranges (in the order of 10^-15 m or so). Once you go below this range, the attraction will override any other force. Even uncharged neutrons are affected by this. This force is what keeps atom nuclei bound together.
You could say that this is one reason nuclear fusion is so hard to achieve. Unlike fission, you?õ????ve got to bring atoms

In general, though, one does not have to share in, or even like, all the features stereotypical of a given culture, to be considered (or to consider oneself) part of that culture. Not all Irish like to dance and drink and tell stories. Not all Arabs wear robes and ride camels. Not all Jews eat chopped liver and wear beanies. Not all Japanese like sushi and watch anime.

There is no direct way to introduce a similar group (called orthoester) that would protect an ester:

but the opposite does work.
So you could see an orthoester as a functional group that would lead to an ester but you can?õ????t use it to protect an ester that already is in your molecule.
Traditional ways to make orthoesters are via
But as mentioned you could use it as ?õ????protective?õ???ù group: it is stable to strong nucleophiles and bases.
see also a scheme used by E.J. Corey (Corey is a Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry) Corey used an acid chloride and an oxetane alcohol that transforms into a cyclic orthoester that is used as protecting group. It is cleaved later in the synthesis to the carboxylic acid again.

What is the best way to deal with some condescending salespeople at high-end stores?	"Here is how one of my best frame shop customers deals with such things. How sadly funny it is that she ever had to put up with the snob effusions. No one is a better friend to a peddler of upscale goods, whether it is a commissioned salesperson or a shop owner.
She walks in upscale stores in sweatshirts, old jeans and other clothing styles that do not scream affluence. If she knows you, she does not do it, but in new stores, she tests the salespeople to see if the stellar service is universal, not snob-based. If a salesperson refuses to provide polite and energetic service, she either goes somewhere else or asks for another salesperson.
You could use that method. But if another salesman [or a manager] backed the snobby salesperson up, saying the store did not carry that size, you would have to accept the fact that it did, indeed, come from?õ?????õ?????õ?????õ?????õ????.an outlet.
So what if it came from an outlet.
The perception of rudeness is often in the tone of voice more than in the words uttered or the information conveyed. It is hard to quantify rudeness or snoberry for that reason, but we all know it when we see it.
The same thing is true in stores when customers are upset and, rather than asking for other types of service, expect empathy, especially when even the manager has no control over remedying the situation, like when a size is only available at an outlet.
A good salesperson tries to find a way around the situation to satisfy the customer.
Sometimes, managers have the flexibility to make compromises with customers, like various types of returns. Even if they can?õ????t accommodate the request, they apologize to the customer, whether or not it was their fault, saying oh I am so sorry for the inconvenience.
Some salespeople find a parallel in their life, telling the inconvenienced customer about a time when they tried to return something and found out it came from an outlet. They had to drive all the way to [fill the blank] outlet mall and are so sorry that your shirt is no longer in stock at this store. We have a similar shirt at this store ?õ???? see ?õ???? but it is not that shirt, which is an excellent shirt in a good color for you.
Your uncle chose well.
A tactful salesman in an upscale store probably would not mention the outlet thing. Luxury is the point of an upscale store. But many affluent shoppers, like the one from my picture frame shop, prefer to be treated like any other well-serviced customer.
We all know that outlets exist.
Rich people know, poor people know. Everyone in-between knows. Truth is, without the employee discount, most of the salespeople in upscale stores could never afford to purchase a full-priced item in the stores they man.
A good salesperson would just say the store did not carry the size, possibly calling around to other stores to see if the size was in stock if customers were not backed up in line. S/he would find a way to make you feel like a customer so that you might come back to provide repeat business.
The best way to handle it is just don?õ????t ask for that salesman if you shop there in the future. Don?õ????t let him/her ring you up, gaining any commission, assuming they are even on commission. Many upscale stores do not have commission salespeople despite what customers think.

What does it mean when a child sucks their thumb? Could it be an automatic response to something?	"It might possibly related to breast-feeding instincts. Trying to eradicate the habit is tricky business. But developmentally, if a child continues thumb sucking into school age, it might be worth checking into.
There?õ????s one other issue. (And I?õ????m no expert). I?õ????ve had several jobs that have brought me into close contact with inner-city children. I have noticed several inner-city teenage boys and girls sucking thumbs (they often try hiding the behavior by holding their hands over their mouths with their thumbs tucked inside). I didn?õ????t know what to make of it.
But then I read that older children and even adults in war-torn parts of the world sometimes continue to suck their thumbs, possibly as a result of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Kids in inner-city neighborhoods can have experiences not unlike those living in distressed, war-torn communities.
So, especially if practiced in later years, the habit could be a sign of something deeper going on.
Here?õ????s one citation for the PTSD and thumb-sucking connection:

"Do Pakistan have great danger to their sovereignty if they don't have nuclear weapon while their rival neighbor, India has one? Why?"	"In order to answer this question first I would like to ask a simple question. Suppose you (Pakistan) have a friend named India. You two are sons of same mother named
In the same way India and Pakistan have fought 4 major wars with each other named-
And in the year 1974 India tested it's first nuclear weapon in the operation named
India's sole purpose to develop nuclear weapons can be understood in words of late prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru-
That is -
India never developed nuclear weapons in order to attack foreign territory or to show its power. But Pakistan never understood it. China whose sole purpose was to create tension between India and Pakistan so that it's dominance can never be challenged helped Pakistan developed nuclear weapons whose sole purpose was to destroy India in any upcoming war. This can be understood by given photo-
Many declassified documents of CIA clearly mention that it was China who sold nuclear reactor thus helping Pakistan develop nuclear weapons.
So at last Pakistan shall not have any danger if they hadn't developed nuclear weapons because India's purpose was not to hurt any other country Sovereignty. It was just a plan made by China and other countries in order to contain India's growth and power in international community.

One day, as usual, he entered the class and everyone recited ?õ????good morning sir?õ????, but there was an over excited guy among them(me) who loudly said ?õ????good evening sir?õ???? (it was 10 am). No need to say that I just had pissed him off, but he didn?õ????t notice who shouted. He asked the criminal to surrender, but I was too brave to do that, and none of my friends was going to betray me. Well, there was no escaping, he sent the whole section into the open sun, in the playground, for 15 minutes. In no time, every guy came to know it was me due to whom they were punished, so they were staring at me in disgust, and I had no I idea what to say. Most awkward thing was seeing the girls looking at me as if I am a murdrer or what. I was embarressed af. If my friends were not there to motivate me for more such acts, I might have cried.

Why don't you believe in climate change? What data do you have to support your belief?	"It would not be accurate to say I ?õ????don't believe in climate change.?õ???ù What I do have, though, is a question.
In my ancient science classes, we were taught about the experimental method. You form a hypothesis (for example, ?õ????human-emitted carbon in the atmosphere is causing the temperature to go up,?õ???ù) then you test that hypothesis by an experiment. You create an experimental group where one single variable ?õ???? the one in your hypothesis ?õ???? is changed, and everything else is left the same. Then, you create a control group, where no variables are changed at all. If the change in that single variable produces the result in your hypothesis, you would say that your hypothesis has been tested and is more likely to be true.
Here's the question I have always wondered about and for which I never discovered a satisfying answer: there's only one earth, how can we possibly have an experimental group and a control group? And even if we could, the earth is filled with billions of constantly changing factors, how could we possibly create a situation where only one variable ?õ???? human-emitted carbon ?õ???? changes?
I assume the obvious answer is that we do all this through computer models rather than actual experiment. If that is in fact the answer to my first question, I have a follow up question: the earth is a part of the universe, and that is an infinite system. In an infinite system, how can we ever attain confidence that our computer models account for all the important possible variables?
It's not that I don't believe in climate change. It's that this culture of absolute certainty about it doesn't fit in at all with what I learned in my old high school physics classes.

Depending on how unique the plaid designs on them are, you may be able to find a close match, maybe not. You?õ????re best to go to a tailor store with a lot of fabrics in person. I would recommend avoiding online because it can be very difficult to discern the exact shade of a fabric online as it depends on the lighting.

Also, the spacing between the plaid pattern could be slightly different, making it look even worse.

But if you be stubborn without reason and doesn't listen to others even if you are wrong or you unnecessarily hold on to your argument when it's no longer needed and want that everyone should agree to what you say than it's not good.
One should always listen to others cause one can never be always right and sometimes or I would say many times others may have better opinions, answers, solutions or idea about a particular thing than you. It's very necessary to develop the habit of listening and accepting when you are wrong else no one is going to be with you for long.

When and what made you aware of emotional intelligence?	"I was getting yelled at by a nurse.
I was facilitating a training session for front line caregivers dealing with ""difficult"" patients at a big regional healthcare system. And one of the nurses was yelling at me.
How could you use this patient! That is so unfair. She's totally uncooperative.
That was really interesting for me because earlier I had seen another nurse laugh all the way through her meeting with that patient.
The patient wasn't actually a patient. She was a terrific actor I'd hired named Ellen Dessler. Ellen was playing a woman with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
The scenario was that Ellen had just been diagnosed with COPD and had been told that she couldn't fly in an airplane. So, she couldn't attend a family reunion, and might never see her distant family members again.
I didn't coach her to be mean or uncooperative. I gave her the backstory you just read (and about a page more), asked her to step into that role (we practiced quite a bit), and asked her to respond to the way she was treated by the staff we were training.
(These kinds of scenarios turn out to be really realistic and effective. Drop me a message if you're interested in details.)
So, the really interesting thing to me was that one nurse had a bad experience with this patient, while another laughed through the encounter.
So, of course, it hit all of us that it wasn't Ellen, the patient, who caused the good and poor experiences but the different approaches taken by the staff.
That set me on the path of looking for deliberate practices that created great experiences for people in pain and distress. That was back when John Gottman was just getting into emotion coaching with kids.
I exchanged a couple of emails with him. We started teaching a version of his techniques and added some others that were specially suited to care givers who needed to make requests of patients (and not just get along with them).
And we discovered that we could identify and teach ways to listen, what to listen for, ways to phrase feedback and requests that could make even very tough interactions (with people in inpatient psych, with patients wanting to sue, with people who had to escorted off the property by security) go much better.
We could even create rapport and get cooperation pretty rapidly by paying close attention to the patients and being responsive to them in particular ways.
And it all started with a nurse who had the courage to yell at me.

"If an 8 gauge shotgun was made for modern sporting and with modern smokeless powder, what would the firearm look like and its effectiveness?"	"A modern sporting rifle?

Looking into the hotlime kiln, those are good little pingpong ball sized lime, but when boulders start showing up we bust out the shotty. As you can see from the picture, it sits on a solid steel frame and probably weighs close to 500 pounds, even then we have to anchor the gun when shooting as the recoil will move that heavy turret back causing you to realign every shot. I cant imagine a shoulder fired variant, maybe for one shot just to say you did it but it would beat you like a red headed step child!

Why do people prefer software jobs after completing a BE/BTech in ECE or EEE in mechanical instead of core jobs?	"1. Engineering students don't value engineering. Most of them are literally wasting their precious time on useless things like social media and are busy in impressing girls/boys and their friends. They will spend 2 hours in clicking a perfect selfie, Updating their relationship status even if in reality they are single. Engineering boys posting 'My Dear you are so cute/hot/sexy/etc' on a random girl's facebook post. Girls are busy in posting their legendary awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
wwwwwws, annoying duckface selfies. Their relationship ends faster than an
2. They don't know about the job opportunities in their core fields, I was surprised when I asked my friends from other engineering departments(Mech,ECE,EE,C
ivil) about their dream job and they replied that their goal was to get placed in IT companies like Infosys, Tcs, accenture etc. Reasons were very high salary after 4-5 years and good looking girls in the office they can marry.
3. Some students attend lectures day and night. I have many classmates obsessed with 100% attendance. In 8th sem B.E I have friends with attendance of 98%,99% and 100%. Come on ! Its not the time to attend lectures rather its the time to explore the real world, preparing for jobs or higher studies.
4. Engineering professors! Most of them don't know what they are teaching. Most became professors not to teach but to earn. They are irritated when you ask them the question they don't know to answer. They give those shitty assignment which is a mere work of ctrl-c and ctrl-v . Professors force student to attend their lectures by threatening them to fail in internals and practicals. Students then sit and learn outdated syllabus which has no value in terms of job perspective. They thus fail to develop necessary knowledge and skills for jobs.
6. Whatever may be your field your colleges should encourage programming. I find many tier 3 college don't encourage programming. They just teach that annoying 'Hello World!' program in 10 different languages. CS related stuff have tremendous jobs but they just don't find the right skill.
7. Some answers are saying its supply vs demand and I do not agree completely with it because 80-90% of students don't learn anything in their Engineering at all. You can discard their degree so it is Quality vs supply, Think like an employer why will I hire an undergraduate who knows to code programs like 'Hello World!' only, Who sat in the class to learn outdated syllabus that too he forgot a week after the exams. Why I would waste my money to hire graduates who don't have open source projects, Internships, personal projects, Techincal blogs etc but just has a resume displaying a CGPA of 7 and above? I would instead hire a person without a degree but with skills and background.
And the list goes on.
My answer may be out of the context of the question, But I wanted to describe the current situation of Indian engineers and the reasons I think for not getting any jobs. The answer may get downvoted but I don't care.

Do real men wear pink underwear?	"Real Men wear pink. As in shirts usually and a nice pink is a pastel washed out pink.
Real Men wear pink because they are confident as aforementioned by another OP in their manhood and sexuality.
Now, on the other hand wearing a pair of pink pants unless extremely washed out and then even so, would likely be considered effeminate and to be honest with you likely look so too. Or a pink jacket? No. Just no.
Thus, I would limit my pinks to T-shirts, and Button down shirts. Some accessories as well like a bandana or maybe some kind of hat with some pink in it and maybe brown or black.
Underwear on the other hand is a little different.
Underwear is also private. So if your girlfriend likes it, then your call. I would venture most women may question a man wearing pink underwear.
What I do know is I don?õ????t think I remember ever seeing a pair of pink underwear on sale anywhere for men. Likely, because the designer, manufacturer, store and customer will not buy them. So essentially they are pissing money away into those pink undies! Or I just don?õ????t shop in those stores.
This is what a simple google search yields for ?õ????mens pink underwear?õ???ù these are all clearly models and are paid to wear these to show off their abs and it?õ????s a bit obvious it is geared towards men who like men. To each is own.
Personally I do not like any of the styles shown, some of the colors are ok. But the style is mainly to attract other men not women.

Did any WWI tanks carry armor piercing rounds? Were any of the rounds they carried effective against other tanks?	"As many answers have stated, the Germans produced a minuscule amount of tanks compared to that of the Allies. The Allies built thousands while the Germans only made around 20. So the probability of 2 tanks fighting each other was small.
But, aside from that, the role of tanks in the first world war were purely support. The main objective of the tank was to escort advancing troops into No-Mans-Land and break through enemy lines.
When a tank broke through enemy lines, it?õ????s main purpose was to cause havoc and confusion behind enemy lines. This would mean attacking troops, bunkers and trenches, but not actual tanks. A high explosive shell would be more effective for taking out positions and since a tank had no real opposition from other armored vehicles, it had no need to carry anti-tank shells. The bigger danger would be from actual troops and field guns, which could be taken out with HE shells.
Then, there was the barrels. During the First World War, tank barrels were manually moved, and were made shorter to make the move easier. An anti-tank round requires more velocity to penetrate a tank?õ????s armor, and thus, needs a longer barrel. Since the tank barrels were manually turned, a longer barrel would mean a longer turn time, which could put the crew in danger, should it need to fire back quickly.
Tanks during the First World War carried only 1 type of ammunition, HE shells. During the First World War, if a tank crew fired an HE shell at another tank, it would be pretty ineffective. At best, you could disable the tank by hitting it?õ????s tracks, but you would most likely send the German War Minister a heavily dented tank. So, HE shells were useless against enemy tanks since it could not pierce the armor.
There were a couple ways to take out a tank in World War 1. The first, and most common, was artillery. Artillery was basically moved and pointed towards the tank and fired. this was actually pretty effective, and was used throughout the war. The second was actual tank rifles. Rifles such as the TankGewehr were high caliber rifles that could penetrate a tank?õ????s armor, and damage it.
Then, there were other types of explosives such as dynamite and anti-tank grenades which were very rare, but still effective.
So, in the end, there was really no need to issue anti-tank rounds because it would be a waste of space and material as well as dangerous for the crew.

How do husbands remain faithful to their wives?	"Tempted? I?õ????m tempted to do all sorts of things. If I?õ????m at a friend?õ????s house and I see he?õ????s left some money lying around, I?õ????m tempted to steal it. But I don?õ????t, because that would be mean. Like most adults, I have impulse control.
People who cheat tend to have poor impulse control and no impetus to get help for that problem. Often, drugs or alcohol are involved. They weaken impulse control even further.
Or they?õ????re people who aren?õ????t continually communicating with their spouses. Or they?õ????re depressed?õ????or in some other mentally-agitated state where they?õ????re too needy to care about anyone but themselves.
Most of these problems are treatable, but lots of people don?õ????t get treatment.

This updating would consist on importing data from present 1.6 version to new 1.7 version, which apart from using new tables, as in former version releases, tables always have some field renaming, property change or new fields added.
The updating plan I have designed is focused on transferring catalogue, customer and order data (I have not considered yet template or module issues since keeping data it is the most important in the migration process).
1) Make a new Prestashop 1.7 installation
2) Copy present PS 1.6 tables related to PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS and ORDERS

4) Sql export those data originally from PS 1.6 but now modified as PS 1.7 and with data
5) Import or insert former data into PS 1.7 tables of new installation

What is the leftist ideology?	"Its called leftist Ideology because during French Revolution of 1789, the parties with this ideology used to sit on the left side of the King in National Assembly. This is how the ""left wing"" and ""right wing"" came into picture. They are also called communists.
There ideology supports equality everywhere. They are against inequal/unfair treatment of any person.?ˇ They are against discrimination based on Religion and caste.?ˇ They support trade unions and their strikes. Thats why in West Bengal and Kerala we hear about regular strikes by workers. These are the two states in which left parties are strong. They ruled WB for 34 years and are major opposition in Kerala as of now.
Note: These days very few political parties follow their ideology.
The Maoist (Naxals) have the same ideology but they took up violence.
Some of the famous communists are: Karl Marx,
China, North Korea are some communists countries, previously USSR (Russia and many small countries) was communist.

Do functional alcoholics exist outside of TV/movies?	"I won several sales awards, worked, drove, I thought I drove better because I drank. I was the life of the party.

My tolerance for alcohol was incredible. I drank bottles of wine a night, not glasses.
My pain from everything I had gone thru was shoved deep in my brain.
No one lasts forever as a functioning alcoholic. My wife and friends knew I was a drunk. My life was spiraling out of control.
My wife left me. She screamed ?õ????you?õ????re an alcoholic.?õ???ù
My friends said since she left I could REALLY drink.
I quit drinking ?õ????cold turkey.?õ???ù Drinking was a habit that was hard to break.

Why was financial minister Pravin Gordhan removed from the South African administration?	"South Afrcan (SA) ?õ????president?õ???ù Jacob Zuma is the archetypal African banana republic dictator who ignores the sight of poor masses clamouring for a better deal as he whisks past them in his luxury limousine.
Zuma is precisely what the likes of Nelson Mandela did
Zuma wants to commit the SA economy to certain deals. His objective: to rake in telephone-number bribes. He has
In order to achieve this he needs pliable, yes-men ministers who will do his bidding without questioning their orders. Finance ministers Nene and Gordhan are not such yes-men; they firmly said no when called upon to do Zuma?õ????s bidding.
So Zuma fired them.
Nene was fired in December 2015. Zuma fired Nene and replaced him with yes-man van Rooyen. There was such a backlash that Zuma was, in a matter of hours, forced to climb down and replace Van Rooyen with Gordhan.
Now Zuma has fired Gordhan and replaced him with yes-man Gigaba, a self opinionated buffoon with a track record of utter devastation in each portfolio to which he has been assigned.
Zuma learnt from his mistake with Nene - but learnt in all the wrong ways. He didn?õ????t learn to focus on SA?õ????s economic wellbeing. What learnt is how to do a better job of getting away with appointing stooges to do his bidding.
is Zuma his own man? Not at all. Zuma is a puppet on a string. The puppeteers are four brothers, Gupta by name. The Gupta brothers currently operate from Dubai. Using Zuma as their proxy, the Gupta bothers exercise an unheard-of degree of control over the SA economy. The Gupta brothers have amassed a fortune that, if not yet in the Soros league, is at least beginning to climb towards that altitude.
Jacob Zuma is their tool. (Read those five words in the appropriate sense.)

"Does the government have a responsibility to release all information related to UFO ""sightings"" to the public?"	"If we universally have reasons to believe that ?õ????the government?õ???ù or all world governments operated for the common good of the people they govern at all times, then the ?õ????National Security?õ???ù reason would hold water.
However, I do not believe that most if not all governments operate for the common good of the people all of the time. The reason is that governments at large have an ultimate priority that?õ????s based on self-preservation. As long you have human beings whose livelihood depend on their jobs as a government official, they cannot be trusted to be fully ethically adroit, transparent and care 100% for the people they serve. This idea has been historically proven why human cannot be fully trusted.
Terms such as, ?õ????This information cannot be revealed for the sake of National Security.?õ???ù and/or when top government officials and even Presidents are told that ?õ????They don?õ????t have a need-to-know?õ???ù certain information by our clandestine agencies suggest a level of secrecy that feels rotten to the core. The specter of unwarranted and uncontrollable power to one branch of government becomes a real possibility.
So the whole idea of secrecy, even if it legitimately falls under the prevention of exotic military technology from being disclosed to enemy hands, is still too big of a loophole that may be used by the powerful with selfish interest to prevent ground breaking information from being revealed to the public rightfully so.
So I?õ????d say ethically, the government does have a responsibility to discern the difference from truly destructive information from paradigm changing, positive information that can upgrade the current state of mankind and reveal such information to the public.
It is a crime against humanity IMO, if the government(s) know that we?õ????ve been visited by off-world entities, have engaged in a clandestine exchange program with them, have access to free technology that would free us from our dependency on fossil fuel and big industry economic control, that would propel science and human knowledge away from a stagnant position and decided to distribute this information only to a select wealthy few so that they can discern how this wealth of information is used. Based on historical and investigated evidence, all documentations suggest that the above assertion, has indeed been the case.
All the government would have to state is:
We have indeed been visited by beings from certain other star systems or parallel dimensions. At this point, we?õ????re still trying to establish a rapport and communication with such beings. There will be more to disclose at a later time as long as it does not compromise our current state of National Security.
Such statement may shake up current world views and trigger some intense arguments, discussions, and questions. Unless the government has some sinister reasons that?õ????s either human or alien based to sit on this news, I believe that without question, that most human beings, can handle this information.

What basic science research is likely to get defunded by Trump and the GOP?	"My guess is any kind of basic sciences research, that puts pharmaceutical or service provider (hospital chains) industry products in immediate jeopardy - as identified by them, to the administration - this could be robotics, this could be mature stem cell technologies (biological, not drug or device) developmentally almost ready for the clinic.
Any basic sciences research that has been going around in circles which has added not much value to science or progress, is worth defunding, in financial terms; no research is worth defunding, in absolute terms (because it all adds to a body of knowledge) - but this reminds me of a Nephrologist UT Medical School hired - his clinical research proved that the rare Hepatitis G virus, is transmitted parenterally in kidney transplant patients, and is almost always associated with Hepatitis C virus?õ?????õ????..at the time I thought it was kind of a prime example of useless clinical research?õ?????õ?????õ????whereas more recently, this virus is thought to reduce the severity of HIV co-infection, because it blocks HIV virus from entering into lymphocytes - no one could have guessed that, when the ?õ????useless?õ???ù clinical research was being done!

Don?õ????t forget to use a Torrent VPN before any torrent download in case if you are unable to access these Torrenting websites from your region due to copyright law and censorship policies
Millions of Torrent fans and users was shocked and left stunned when Kickass Torrent was seized for operations when its owner Artem Vaulin, was arrested over different copyright law violation and money laundering charges.KAT is the top Torrent website holds millions of users who facilitate themselves with the huge and mega Torrent library.
Following the aftermath of KAT shutdown the huge wave of disappointment and rage was found among Torrent fanatics and Torrenting community as whole was against this sadistic arrest of KAT owner as they consider it a fight between copyrights clowns and them. As far as the Torrent users are concerned they are in search of new Torrent websites as huge as KAT, so here we have listed down substitute of KAT below,
No matter if KAT is shut down, we wish it will rise and shine again like TPB has already gone through this tragic phase and returned blooming. TPB is the perfect alternative of KAT with not the same but very huge and massive Torrent library so you can download thousands of movies, music, videos, software, Apps, Torrents etc and what not, but as TPB itself said don?õ????t forget to secure your Torrent download by hiding your IP address and by using a VPN. The procedure for a safe and secure Torrent Download via TPB is to use a VPN and most recommended VPN is ExpressVPN.
Three clones of KAT we have listed down here are still in full operation and providing access to the library for the Torrent download before listing it here we have checked it and verifies it using a VPN from different locations so to make sure it works for you ,
We recommend IsoHunt for all KAT users and fans due to the most used Torrent library that is almost so close to KAT Torrent library. You can also share your issues, tips and suggestions regarding Torrent and Torrenting by taking part in the largest community powered by IsoHunt for Torrenting.
Although Torrent Hound has not a huge library as of KAT, IsoHunt and TPB but still if you love to download latest movies and TV shows then you will love it simple download navigation and website layout with all the statistics displayed on the landing page about total files, servers etc. and you can find the most recent downloaded files with their link to download and recent searches. It a good substitute for KAT and one of our top pick for Torrent fans.

What is the easiest way to gain followers on Instagram?	"Just buy them from the
First things first: Customize your Instagram profile to make it look good, tell your potential followers who you are, and give them a reason to follow you.
How? Start by making sure your username is recognizable and easily searchable -- like your business name. If your business name is already taken, try keeping your business name as the first part of your username so that people searching for your business are more likely to come across you. For example, the Australian activewear line Lorna Jane uses the username
(
Next, make sure your profile is public. To make your profile public, open Instagram, open ""Options,"" and make sure ""Private Account"" is turned off.
Next, choose a profile picture that's on-brand with your other social networks, like your company logo.
Then, fill your bio with delightful, actionable, and informative information about your brand. Information like this lets people know what you're about and gives them a reason to follow you. Include who you are and what you do, and be sure to add a hint of personality. Here are a few examples for inspiration:
Next, add a link to your bio to make it easy for people to go straight from Instagram to your website if they want to. The space allotted for URLs is precious real estate because it's the only place within Instagram where you can place a clickable link, so use it wisely. We recommend using a shortened, customized
Finally, enable notifications so you can see when people share or comment on your photos. This'll let you engage with them more quickly -- just like a lot of companies do on Twitter. To enable notifications, go to ""Options"" and then ""Push Notification Settings."" Select ""From Everyone"" for every category.
A word to the wise: We
Just like there should be one (
If you work for a large organization, you might find that a lot of people want to have a say in what's posted. That's when an organized request or guidelines document comes in hand. This document should inform people how to request a post on your Instagram account, when, the value of the post, and why.
On Instagram, post quality matters. A
Since Instagram is a mobile app, chances are, most of the photos you post to Instagram will be taken on your mobile device. That's not just okay; it's expected. While some brands use professional photography for their Instagram photos, most use smartphones -- and that's the vibe that Instagram is meant for, anyway.
Start by
Instagram has some basic editing capabilities, but oftentimes, they aren't adequate to make a picture really, really great. Most of your photos should go through at least one or two other photo editing apps on your mobile phone before you open them in Instagram for the first time.
Once you've created and optimized your profile, have someone manning it, and know a thing or two about phone photography and photo editing, it's time to start posting. It's a good idea to have a solid number of great posts up -- maybe 15 or so -- before you start really engaging people and working down this list. That way, when people visit your profile, they'll see a full screen of photos instead of just a handful, so they know you'll be posting great content regularly.
To start posting on Instagram, first
Keep your target persona in mind when you first start planning out your posting schedule, as that can drastically change your posting timing and frequency -- especially if you're targeting an audience in a different time zone. (
While optimizing your schedule for your specific audience will take time and experimentation,
However, because Instagram is primarily an app for use on mobile devices, users tend to use the network all the time, any time -- although many users engage with content more during off-work hours than during the workday. Some businesses have also seen success with posting at 2:00 a.m., 5:00 p.m., and Wednesdays at 7:00 p.m. Experiment with these to see if they work with your audience.
Although it's best to have only one or two people manning your account, one or two people can't be everywhere at once taking photos. What about that fun sushi night the engineers had last night? Or the event your head of sales spoke at earlier this week? There's a whole breadth of content you'll want to post to Instagram, and more often than not, one person won't be able to keep track of it all.
One solution? Create a system where you can curate photos and content from members of your team. There are a few ways to do this. One is to create a specific email address for employees to send their photos, short videos, memes, hyperlapses, and so on. Just encourage people to put a subject line on these emails so you can more easily sort through the photos they're sending. While this doesn't seem like the smoothest way to curate photos, it's actually the easiest for the people sending you photos -- and the easier you can make it for them to send content, the more content you'll get.
If your team shares a Box or Dropbox account, you could also create a shared folder where people can automatically drop their photos and videos. This just makes a few more steps for the people sending you the content, and not everyone might have that app downloaded on their phones.
Photos and videos might be the most important part of your Instagram posts, but captions should never be an afterthought. They're an essential part of your post -- icing on the cake, if you will. Consistently great captions can do wonders for humanizing your brand, winning over followers, and making your content more shareable -- thereby giving you more exposure.
My colleague
The voice is filled with personality -- note the cheeky hashtag
Another way to increase the shareability of your caption and engage your followers is to ask questions or have some sort of call-to-action in the captions of your photos. For example, you might say, ""double-tap if you find this funny"" or ""share your story in the comments."" In the example below, we asked followers to share photos of their desk with the @HubSpot Instagram account for the chance to be featured.
Let's go back to hashtags for a second. On Instagram, a hashtag ties the conversations of different users who wouldn't already be connected into a single stream. If you use relevant hashtags, your posts will get exposure to a wider audience than the people who already follow you or know about your brand. (
The key to using hashtags effectively is to use them smartly and sparingly. Try to limit the number of hashtags per caption to around three. Similarly, don't use ""like for like"" hashtags, like #like4like or #like4likes. This is a dirty tactic that'll leave you with a whole bunch of low-quality followers.
To find the hashtags your audience might be using, do a little research on relevant hashtags in your niche or industry. The easiest way to do this research is in the Instagram app itself, in the ""explore"" tab (i.e. the magnifying glass icon). When you search for one hashtag, it'll show you a list of related hashtags at the top of your screen. For example, when I search for #inboundmarketing on Instagram, it shows me relevant hashtags like #marketingdigital, #marketingtips, and so on.
To help relate to your followers on a personal level, you might consider hopping on hashtag trends like #tbt (""Throwback Thursday""), #MotivationMonday, #TransformationTuesday, or hashtags that are trending at any given time. Here's a post from @HubSpot's account using the #MotivationMonday hashtag:
Once you build up a bit of a following, you can try creating your own hashtags -- like your company name or a slogan that applies to a lot of your photos. This is a great way to build up your brand on the platform and build a more cohesive presence.
Instagram is very much a community, and one great way to get involved in that community is to find people who post pictures that interest you, and follow their accounts and interact with their content. It's the most natural way to draw attention to your own Instagram account while getting your foot in the door in the community, and getting inspiration from others' content.
That does two things for you: For one, when they get the notification that you've followed them, they might check out your account and decide whether or not to follow you. (This is why it's important to have some great content on there before you start reaching out to others.) Secondly, it means you'll be seeing their recent posts in your feed, so you can Like and interact with them if you choose to.
As you build a following, celebrate your followers and show you appreciate them by responding to their comments, and even following them and engaging with their posts.
Once you build a solid relationship with some of the folks behind these accounts that have a similar audience to your own, you might ask to do some co-promotion on each others' accounts. The more natural and less spammy you can make the content of these cross-promotions -- especially the captions -- the better. It also helps to be picky about them, and don't do them very often.
Below is an example of what that looks like from food blogger @sprinklesforbreakfast and photographer @graymalin, who cross-promoted each others' accounts at about the same time:
Another great way to expand your reach while increasing engagement on your photos is to publish a post promoting a contest, and then ask people to follow your account and Like or comment on the photo in order to enter.
You might add a UGC (User-Generated Content) element to the contest, too, where people post a photo of their own and use a specific hashtag along with following your account. Here's an example of a post from Starbucks promoting a UGC contest on their Instagram account.

Using any social network aimlessly can lead to wasted resources and a low return on investment?õ????and Instagram is no exception. Having a strategy in place will help you define what you want to achieve, so you can better target and attract new followers relevant to your business.
Whether you?õ????re starting from scratch or adjusting your current Instagram efforts, here are three elements for building a solid Instagram strategy.
Analyzing what your competitors are doing on Instagram will show you:
Now that
No matter what industry your business is in, you have a story to tell that is perfectly suited for a highly visual social network like Instagram. A compelling narrative in your content will give it a sense of purpose and can inspire word-of-mouth from your current community, making your Instagram account more attractive to new followers.
Satisfy curiosity by showing followers how your product is made, share the perspective of an employee to humanize your brand, or position your brand in an aspirational way by showcasing the lifestyle or achievements of your customers. You don?õ????t have to limit your Instagram strategy to only one of these groups. Most successful brands will tell all of these stories at once in different ways and perhaps across different social channels.
Since your Instagram strategy will only be as effective as the goals it was designed to achieve, you need to know what you?õ????re aiming for. We suggest
If you?õ????re struggling to attract new followers on Instagram, a simple (yet often overlooked) solution is to make it easier for people to find you. Increase the number of ways that potential new followers can discover your Instagram account.
Here are some specific suggestions:
This may seem like a no-brainer but it can?õ????t be stressed enough: the better your Instagram content is, the more likely you are to get more Instagram followers. Posting photos that are blurry, branded inconsistently, or simply not interesting provides no incentive for people to follow you. Here are some guidelines for improving your Instagram content strategy.
Use the insight you have about your customers to help determine
The most effective way of determining the best time to post on Instagram is by testing how your photos perform at different times of day. If you notice that photos you post in the mornings are consistently earning you more likes, comments, or followers than those posted in the afternoon or evening, then adjust your content schedule accordingly.
Here at
There?õ????s no magic number for how often you should be posting to Instagram, but
Pressed for time? Schedule Instagram photos (along with their captions) in advance through Hootsuite. For details on how to do this, click
Including relevant hashtags in your captions will help your posts appear to people who may not already be following you, but are searching for photos related to your brand on industry. Before using hashtags to get more Instagram followers, make sure to review:
For more on mastering the hashtag, check out
Although Instagram is a highly visual platform, your photo captions play a big role in helping you get more Instagram followers. As we explain in
Instagram is the perfect place to take advantage of video, a trend that is only continuing to grow and dominate social media. The brands that are leading the pack when it comes to Instagram video are attracting new followers through user-generated content, fun and innovative videos that showcase their products, DIY tips, tutorials, and content that piques (and satisfies) curiosity.
Running contests on Instagram can help further grow your audience, drive traffic to your website, and even help you sell product. To enter the contest, ask people to either follow you, like, comment on one of your photos, use a specific hashtag, or repost one of your photos. Encouraging user-generated content as part of your contest will help you reach more people. Those who don?õ????t follow you already will be exposed to your Instagram account through a post created by one of their friends, which is an effective way of building trust with new followers.
Benefit Cosmetics has successfully used Instagram contests to tie together the online and offline experience of their customers. For a recent campaign, they partnered with beauty retailer Ulta to run an Instagram contest that encouraged users to share a selfie after a visit with a brow expert at a local Ulta store. By following the @BenefitCosmetics account and posting their selfie using the hashtag #browbestie, the customer would be entered to win a year?õ????s worth of brow service as well as $250 in Benefit products.
This contest achieved three things: it acted as an incentive for new followers, it showcased and promoted the in-store experience, and it rewarded the community for an online behavior that came naturally to them.
Incorporating Instagram into your overall marketing campaigns can help you gain new followers and connect the offline and online experience for your customers. For example:
Taco Bell announced they were going to begin serving breakfast in a quick Instagram video that was fun to watch, showed the product, and got their audience excited.
Like all social media networks, Instagram is about the communities built within it. Find potential new Instagram followers by following them first, and then get involved by liking, commenting, and sharing their content?õ????many people will often return the favor.
Collaborating with other successful Instagrammers in your industry can help both you and these influencers reach new audiences and gain increased followers and exposure.
If you have a budget for social advertising, Instagram ads should definitely be on your radar. A sponsored ad is a powerful way to reach new potential Instagram followers, fast. Instagram now allows almost anyone to purchase sponsored posts within the platform, using online ad-buying tools that are
In a study done by Nielsen Brand Effect of more than 400 Instagram advertising campaigns,
If you?õ????re not gaining new Instagram followers at the rate you want, reviewing your metrics and analytics on a regular basis can help you identify areas where you can potentially adjust your strategy.

Where is the best place to learn telepathy?	"The best place to learn telepathy is directly from any telepath near you. But this is less helpful than it seems, because we telepaths hide in plain sight. I think you may already know someone capable of this because you seem to be open to the possibility of telepathy's existence. Here's a few examples of where they may be hiding near you:
People like this are all around you, if you know what signs to look for. It's kind of fitting that to strengthen your own ESP, you need to get out there and meet more people, embrace the weird world, and re-evaluate your definition of ?õ????crazy.?õ???ù Because one or more of my friend's relatives can see ghosts and spirits in mirrors.

Why is the devil's number considered to be 666?	"666 is a reference to the treasury of Solomon (2 Chronicles 9.13, cf 1 Kings 10.14, cf Josephus,
This is the single largest personal fortune recorded in the Old Testament, and represents Solomon's annual intake of treasure. It is an enormous quantity of gold.
Placed on the forehead or hands, the Mark of the Beast is a parody of Israel's Shema:
In the Revelation of John, these two references together represent the idolatry of money, people who worship money and power rather than Israel's God.
One of the earliest controversies in the early church revolved around this number. According to Irenaeus there were some who favored the number 616 and used gematria--a method for numerical calculation popular in Jewish mysticism--to arrive at the name of an emperor. Irenaeus rejected this approach and used a different method as a solution, looking for similar numbers in scripture.
According to New Testament scholar Richard Bauckham, the ""gematria"" solution--rejected almost immediately by church authorities in the second century--was revived by German scholars in 1831. Scholars have been squabbling about which emperor it must refer to--the names Nero and Caligula in particular can both equal 666--ever since.
Gematria is an especially shortsighted answer that ignores the exegetical techniques of the early church and relies on a method of interpretation for which there is no evidence in scriptures--no other puzzle in scripture, not even in Revelation, requires gematria for resolution.

Why do people talk about retirement savings and investments as if they are never going to die?	"Because they want to be prepared for ?õ????What if they live forever??õ???ù
And forever does not have to be ?õ????forever - forever?õ???ù?õ???? Forever starts the day you run out of retirement savings.
Let us say - you assume your life expectancy to be 78 years.
You retire at 62 and have enough saved for 16 years (you anticipate to die by 78).
But firstly life expectancy of 78 usually means that half the people will live beyond that age.
Anyways coming back to your being 62 and retired - everything is fine.
You reach 65?õ????.. 70?õ????.. 75?õ????and still going strong?õ????.. 78?õ???? and you are still alive?õ???? but no money.

Why does a narcissistic play the victim by telling lies about his/her spouse who treated him/her well?	"Because they can not feel guilt. That emotion is not in them. It goes straight to shame. And no narcissist can stand to feel shame.
So they try to make every thing they have done or or said, is blamed on the easiest person to blame it on. The real victim.
They actually believe they have everyone fooled in life. So they have no reason to believe that everyone wouldn?õ????t also believe that they are the victim and their spouse is the abuser.
As well as they see it a ?õ????victim?õ???ù gets more attention and emotional attachment and that is what they want.
As for how the spouse treated the narcissist. The narcissist does not care. They are special, you should of treated them good.
A narcissist will say anything, do anything to convince themselves that they have done nothing wrong.

"If we have piping system with multi branches, will the pump produce head with response to the head of critical branch only?"	"A piping system with multiple parallel branches will have its own unique system diagram that plots pressure differential against flowrate. You can find it by assuming an inlet pressure and calculating the flow rates for each individual branch, then adding them all together. Construct the curve with similar calculations at different pressure levels.
The centrifugal pump has its own curve of head vs flowrate. Convert the head to PSI for the given fluid density and suction pressure.
Compare the system curve for the piping system with the modified pump curve. You?õ????ll note that the two curves have slopes in the opposite directions. The point where the two curves intersect will be the operating point for the system as a whole.
If the two curves don?õ????t cross at a good efficiency point for the pump, you probably have the wrong pump for the piping system.

Is it easy to find full scholarship for MS at NDSU?	"Ahh here is something I have experience in. If you are not from North Dakota and not in high school, then it will be very difficult. This answer will not apply to you. (EDIT: See the edit at the end. )
If both of those statements are true, then yes, it is still hard. Just not as much. North Dakota is generous to it's students. Here is a list of scholarships the state gives out:
The easiest scholarship of these is the academic or CTE scholarship, awarded $750 per year for up to four years. It doesn't sound like a lot but it's almost 10% of the total cost of tuition and room and board.
Step two is to get a 34 on the ACT in your junior year of high school. Yup, you'll need at least that high. This will qualify you for the North Dakota Scholars Program which covers your entire tuition. Only the top 40 scores in the state receive the scholarship and a 34 is, historically, guaranteed to qualify. With a decent GPA, it also qualifies you for a $3000 per year waiver from NDSU.
Unless you are a minority, it is unlikely to receive additional scholarships from State institutions. Having all of these scholarships leaves you with around $3000 to pay yourself each year. If you are dead set of having everything covered, you will need to win money from private businesses.
As someone who is living on campus for the cost of WiFi and hot showers, studying for the ACT is certainly worth it. If you have any other questions on NDSU or financial aid, feel free to message me on Quora.
EDIT: I only described my situation, since that is what I am familiar with. However, I left out an alternative method. This applies if you are a USA citizen.
The CIA (and I?õ????m assuming other agencies) has an Undergraduate Scholarship Program where they will pay you $18,000 per year. That will cover almost everything if you are from ND or from another state with reciprocity. After graduating, you are then obligated to work for the CIA for 1.5 times the length you received the scholarship. More information:
If you are not committed to NDSU, joining the military can provide full tuition and a guaranteed job. I don?õ????t believe you can choose where you want to attend, though.

How do I file a case against Facebook?	"Your question is different and I haven't come across something like this. But I think your issue would be solved by a Civil Court. You're gonna have to provide strong proves that you did nothing to go against the Terms and Comditions of Facebook and then provide your statement that they owe that much money. Then, you'd have to prove that you tried getting your money back but Facebook didn't coordinate. If Facebook actually did block your/your friend?õ????s account, I'd advice against going for a suit. They'd provide more than enough evidence to the Court for not even accepting your case. So try to find a way to contact them and talk about what's going on.

How do people show politeness?	"Some aspects of politeness are culturally specific.
So, I lived with a pair of Japanese girls for a Winter in Canada, and learnt about how politeness is conveyed through seating arrangements and being respectful of communal spaces.
Germans show politeness by being early, and valuing the habit of not wasting other people's time.
Australians show politeness by wanting everyone to feel at home when they come to visit. It's totally ok for my friends to access my fridge for food and drinks whenever they like. Glasses are on the top shelf. Help yourself. Seriously. If I didn't like you, I wouldn't invite you in.

What is the future of art in your opinion?	"The future in art viewing is with AR and VR devices, which will allow us to ""inhabit"" art, and will create another medium entirely. Just as self-driving cars will affect the built environment in which they exist, they will co-evolve in a symbiotic relationship, and extend the possibilities and set new constraints, and modes of working.
Should someone become interested in art in a VR context for example, they might be curious enough to want to explore its history. Art history is holistic, not just a bunch of unrelated fragments. I've also thought about the future of music, and it follows the same curves.
The Gartner Hype Cycle might be a useful benchmark for making predictions and plans for future technologies. VR is on the upward slope, yet counter-intuitively, self-driving cars are heading towards the trough of disillusionment.

Why don't other candidates use some of Trump's tactics?	"Politicians are risk averse.

The DNA, the chemical composition if you will, that?õ????s made Trump?õ????s campaign successful is not for the average, run-of-the-mill politician: first, Trump has been a media presence for two decades; second, he had national name-recognition before the race, and third, he had a successful reality show on network television?õ????and of course, he?õ????s a billionaire. Is there anyone else in America that can check off all of those boxes? I doubt it.
Trump is in the unique position of running in one of the two major parties, yet couldn?õ????t care less about the GOP's long-term success or stability. Trump doesn?õ????t have to fall in line or turn into a bootlicker or party sycophant because he has two things: popularity and a treasure chest filled with F-U money.

Do British people feel closer to Americans than other European Nationals?	"Absolutely not (in my case). A few years ago, I went to the USA thinking it?õ????d be fine and I was blown away by the culture shock> Forget how similar things seem on TV, the USA really is a world apart in ways that you can?õ????t really understand until you go there. Europe, despite language barriers, has never really struck me as hugely different even factoring in my own ?õ????they speak a different language so it?õ????ll be different?õ???ù bias.
In every country I?õ????ve been to in Europe, public transport is easy. In America, everything is about cars. There are drive-thrus everywhere. People don?õ????t seem to walk or get buses outside of big metropolitan areas. A 3 hour drive is ?õ????close?õ???? to an American - if I have a 3 hour drive I?õ????m planning an overnight stay.
Public healthcare. Americans are dead against it, in general. Europeans have a general acceptance that everyone should, could, can and has to look after each other. Americans have their own brand of pioneering, rugged independence, which means that if you can?õ????t afford healthcare, then you need to
Guns. The majority of Americans love guns and want to own them. The majority of Europeans don?õ????t see the point (even if they think guns are cool and fun).
Dancing. This one may be a little contentious, certainly I?õ????ll admit to a large amount of bias here. Through popular culture, I get the impression that dancing is something that Americans do when they?õ????re happy, having fun or to have a good time. It?õ????s really ritualised in some cases. Homecoming king and queen. Prom. First dance at weddings. Personally, I hate dancing, I feel ridiculous doing so, and have to drink heavily in order to not mind. The only reason I do is because women tend to like dancing, and therefore one has to make an effort. That being said, I?õ????ve never been to a house party in Europe where the emphasis is on the music and dancing, rather than drinking and conversation, whereas my friend in the USA took me clubbing sober and was upset I was not having a good time.
Sport. USA plays American football, baseball, basketball, Europeans play football and while there are big sports in different countries (basketball is very popular in Spain, for example, or ice hockey in Iceland, rugby in Wales), there is nothing quite like football.
Internationalism. Americans tend to look inwards to the USA, which I get. Your country is huge, with plentiful resources, you?õ????ve the largest economy in the world and plenty at your doorstep. Europe has always been, is and will always be intertwined. I would say that most Europeans are much more internationalist than Americans; they travel more (it?õ????s easier in Europe), they know geography better, they probably speak more than one language. Britons may not speak other languages well, but chances are most people have been to Spain or France at least once in our lives, and we know a few other European countries, as well as former colonies like Australia and Canada.
Tipping. In America, it?õ????s par for course. In Europe, it?õ????s generally for good service, though probably becoming more Americanised now.
Nudity. Remember all that fuss about ?õ????
Alcohol. 21 to drink but 18 to die for your country? Really not very European.
The USA?õ????s weird politics. To an outside observer, many things about the USA seem very close to fascist while being clearly a democracy. Swearing allegiance to the Flag. The police being basically a paramilitary. The reverence of veterans.

How can I wisely invest $30000?	"I recommend you to start investing, but in order to understand how you can do it you need to know some fundamentals. The main thing for us is to reach the goal, overcoming mistakes and using financial literacy. Don?õ????t be afraid of mistakes and risks. On error you should learn, and try to control the risk. Today?õ????s situation is difficult enough to forecast something without risks and choose great investment opportunities. You should remember the rule: ?õ????Your investments should be in the field you?õ????re interested in and you have knowledge about the sector and subject of your investment?õ???ù. As for me, I should try to buy undervalued assets or assets that reach low and waiting for several years (may be more). And somebody can invest more money and have another BEST STOCK TO INVEST. I would like to claim that investing is a personal thing for everyone and depends not only the quantity of your money, but also on your strategy and many other details.
Moreover you should pay the attention at dividend stocks. Dividend growth investing has grown in popularity. It almost seems magical. Coca-Cola, for example, has raised its dividend every year for the past 53 years. Here is a dividend machine that keeps paying you more and more, year after year. There are a lot of stocks, e.g. AutoZone, Global Sources, O'Reilly Auto, Fossil, Discovery, Fiserv, Citrix, Check Point, Dollar Tree, Celgene, Waters, F5 Networks, Henry Schein, Biogen, Intuitive Surgical, Labcorp, Stericycle etc.These stocks have consistently earned positive cash flows from operations and high ROE (not meaningful for AutoZone, which has negative book value). All of them have embraced share repurchase as a form of shareholder return. AutoZone, for example, has shrunk its shares outstanding by an astonishing 8.2% annually for the past five years. Think of that as a tax free 8.2% dividend yield.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway made generations of investors very rich by paying no dividends (unfortunately, Warren Buffett's years on earth are numbered, and he also admits that his company has grown too large and won't have the same growth it enjoyed in prior years). A diversified basket of dividend stocks, such as those above, can do the same for you today.
The best way to start investing of your money is investing in ETFs, but if you have enough experience you can trade. Also you can easily earn some money in your situation if you invest in ETF, for example, in S&P 500 or Dow Jones. Also you can invest in commodities. For instance, gold. All these variants give you an opportunity to earn enough money to double or triple your capital. Moreover, you can get much more if you have your own strategy and at high time stop your investing/trading activity.

"I am totally fucked up with my life, what should I do?"	"I'm 48 and I have no money, no car, no property, no savings. I do have a degree, and lots of work experience.
I have a small income and I might just be able to buy a car in the next couple of weeks - but it will be a cheap, second-hand car so old most people my age, with a degree, and my work experience would have replaced it two years ago. I rent a small place the size of a holiday apartment. It
When I was 28 I had no money, no car, no work experience, but I did have a degree. At 22 I had no money, no car, no degree, and no work experience.
So things are much better.
All I've ever had, forever, is me. I've never shirked from any type of work. I've always sought to better myself in any job I've done. I worked my way through university - working on a supermarket fish counter mornings, evenings, and weekends to make it possible. Leaving university I tried all kinds of jobs; learning from each; and seeing each as a stepping stone to the next. From little more than my own energy and enthusiasm; and the patience to ""make do"" with whatever life has dealt me in the best possible way; I have always managed to enjoy life. I've traveled on a shoestring.
I've worked extremely hard on a number of business enterprises over the last 15 years, but none of them have been financially fruitful. But that's okay because I enjoyed the work, ensured my work/life balance was good, and I don't regret anything.
In the few seconds before you die your education, work experience, car, or apartment will have absolutely no meaning or bearing on who you are, and how happy you feel - and that's true now.
You have not fucked up your life.
You have done things differently to way most people go about building a life (car, education, apartment, marriage, kids, home, retire at 55). It's not important what order you do those things, and it's not necessary or required that you do those things at all.
Having nothing is persistently liberating. You never have anything to lose if you have nothing.
But if you have your health, a good mind, a readiness to work at whatever job is available - even if it doesn't make you rich - then you can also eat, rent, and enjoy your life.
There is an opportunity for you. You just have to find it - and you have to not be fussy. You have to see every moment as a way to move forward with your life.
Get some work experience - even if it's a job your wouldn't normally choose. Stick at it.... the worse it is, and the longer you persist with it... the more you prove to yourself and others what kind of person you are.
Sometimes you just have to make do with what you've got, or can get, until that amazing opportunity arises. I've filled my time waiting for that amazing, life-changing opportunity by continuously changing my life and having amazing life-changing experiences. So I've looked back - in failure - and realized I was doing what I thought I was working toward all the time. It never matters that I've not managed to build any wealth because the things I value, I already have!
Life is for living, not accumulating. Work on a farm this year; in an office the next; travel the next; educate yourself the next; and the next; and the next; and the next... and just keep going. That's not fucking up - that's living your life.

"In reality, is it possible to become a game designer without active coding?"	"My name is Trey Smith founder of
In fact, many of our customers like Simon Crack, Kevin Wolstenholme, Florian Polkert and David Reichelt have all found a great deal of success.
Simon Crack founder of Dead Cool Apps has had multiple games hit the top of the charts, accumulating millions of downloads. Although he had experience as a professional graphic designer, Simon wasn't a coder when he started making games. He used our drag-and-drop game builder to design games without any active coding. Then he networked on forums and teamed up with different publishers to really help get his games noticed. Simon has created over 200 apps with games like Tumball, Rotaball, Shatters, Strafe, Rebound, Bouncy Block and Circulate all being featured by Apple.
Kevin Wolstenholme founder of RisingHigh Studio has been extremely successful at creating mobile games using Buildbox. The UK-based indie studio has had their games featured by Apple in the 'Best New Games' category over 10 times. They've also received several 'Get your Game on' features by Amazon. Dragonlings, Color Maze, 99 Moons, Parallels, Impossible Caves, Flite, and Dashy Panda are just a few of their hit games.
Also, Florian Porkert created the hit game Ball Jump without coding. The game skyrocketed to the top of the App Store, ultimately becoming the #1 game in more than 54 different countries. It was ranked #1 in the All Apps category in 16 countries as well.

Suppose ,in a situation you did something wrong and you are afraid to tell someone. Hence you start hiding it . Later, you come to realize the mistake you did ; it could be very easily solved. When you hid it, automatically the mistakes were cascaded and ultimately, while solving the mistake it appears huge. Some people who have corrected such mistakes, they will openly share their experiences. When they faced the same kind of issues in their life time before , they did below mentioned things, as I predicted -
1. Openly talk or communicate or interact about the problem's details .
First check if it is a fact or not before taking it by heart.

"Which one is more concentrated, 1 molar of NaOH or 1 moral of NaOH?"	"There is no concentration unit ?õ????moral?õ???ù, or even a concept of ?õ????morality?õ???ù in chemistry, unless you consider many chemists?õ???? concerns about possible misuse of various chemical discoveries. And, of course, the ever-present issue of scientific integrity.
Are you possibly asking about molar vs molal? That would make a lot more sense.
A 1 M (molar) solution contains 1 mole of solute in 1 L of solution.
A 1 m (molal) solution contains 1 mole of solute dissolved in 1 kg of solvent. When the solvent is water, 1 kg = 1 L. But that doesn?õ????t mean that these two concentration units are equal.
Adding 1 mole of NaOH to 1 L of water is going to make the volume increase. Typically it won?õ????t increase by as much volume as the original solid NaOH takes up, but it does increase.
That means that a 1 m (molal) solution contains 1 mole of NaOH in a total volume that is greater than 1 L. Ergo, the 1 molal solution is less concentrated than 1 molar.

The answer is that he?õ????s not, and I don?õ????t think many folks are arguing that he is. The people that did not vote for him sure aren?õ????t arguing that. The people that did vote for him, well, many of them wanted to pull the pin on that grenade and roll it into Washington DC.

Why do liberals in the United States believe in political correctness?	"It?õ????s not clear exactly what the questioner means by ?õ????believe in?õ???ù political correctness, but I?õ????ll assume the intention is something like ?õ????believe that it is good to limit one?õ????s speech to the politically correct?õ???ù.
The only way I know to answer this question is to go off on a bit of a curve, and then answer the original question with ?õ????we don?õ????t?õ???ù ?õ???? but this answer will only make sense after I?õ????ve described what I think ?õ????political correctness?õ???ù means.
To begin with, here?õ????s a definition of ?õ????politically (in)correct?õ???ù that I think doesn?õ????t actually work: ?õ????Speech is politically incorrect if it demeans or insults a non-self-selected group of people for things outside their direct control?õ???ù. This definition doesn?õ????t work (in my view) because (pretty much) everyone agrees that such speech is unacceptable! Or rather, if someone finds it acceptable to demean women or black people or homosexuals or whatever group on the basis of things that are outside their direct control, this answer is not targeted at you and you?õ????re welcome to disregard it.
The phrase ?õ????politically correct?õ???ù originated under certain totalitarian regimes as a code for political dissidents. To assert that a statement was ?õ????politically incorrect?õ???ù was to assert that it was (a) true, and (b) might lead to punishment by the regime. That is, the regime espoused a body of factual assertions, and the dissident feared reprisal for so much as contesting those assertions.
Today in the U.S., one is not going to be punished by the state for espousing and arguing for any facts whatsoever. But it is not only governments that can suppress undesirable opinions; so I think that many people who decry ?õ????political correctness?õ???ù are asserting that there is some kind of powerful body (perhaps an employer, perhaps a university, perhaps the inchoate mass of SJWs) who espouse a body of factual assertions, some of which are false, and who are ready and able to punish those who contest them.
Now clearly ?õ????liberals?õ???ù are not a monolithic group, but it?õ????s probably fair to say there?õ????s a corpus of shared factual premises we share. And yes, we think they?õ????re true! But in my experience, liberals are perfectly happy to defend the truth of those factual assertions, and are not interested in punishing anyone simply for believing a contradictory assertion.
We are, however, known for wanting to prevent/punish
The important thing to take away, however, is when you hear someone say ?õ????I?õ????m about to say something politically incorrect?õ???ù, to see if either of the following is an accurate rephrasing of their intent: (a) ?õ????I am about to make a statement or joke that relies on negative/hateful stereotypes of a group?õ???ù, or (b) ?õ????I am about to make a statement that is both true and could get me in trouble with the powers that be?õ???ù. If the first, shut that shit down. (It is not the government?õ????s job to shut that shit down, of course; it is the role of everyday people to enforce the boundaries of acceptable behavior.) If the second, then one should make a good-faith effort to determine the truth of the assertion they make, and the danger that they face for asserting it.
The fact of the matter, however, is that there is very little reprisal associated with politically inconvenient assertions of fact in the U.S. today. There is reprisal associated with discriminatory/demeaning speech, but this is a good thing (again, as long as we?õ????re not talking about government reprisal against ordinary people?õ????s speech). You should not consider yourself free to make demeaning jokes on the job, and I have no sympathy if you?õ????re fired for doing so.
The one area that does feature repercussions for asserting unpopular ideas is scholarly employment. Scholarly disciplines are expected to police their own boundaries, and can be quite aggressive in doing so, collectively denying careers to those who express ideas which the field at large has rejected. It is very difficult to pursue an academic career in climatology while denying the existence of climate change or the role of human activity in driving it. The working scientists themselves will of course say ?õ????that?õ????s because the evidence for human-driven climate change is overwhelming?õ???ù; the skeptics on the other hand allege being frozen out unfairly. In this case, the scientific consensus is right and the skeptics are wrong, but in principle, a discipline could freeze out true claims via the suffocating orthodoxy of the hiring committee.
But when people cry about ?õ????political correctness run amuck?õ???ù they aren?õ????t typically referring to this academic hiring question (especially since even the most hermetically sealed academic discipline has a few tenured outliers who relish their status as iconoclasts and are happy to mentor similarly iconoclastic students). So the person decrying political correctness has two hurdles to clear: that their ideas are true, and that they?õ????d be punished for espousing them. And I just don?õ????t see it. I do see people getting punished for voicing hateful stereotypes (and I do see a lot of people not getting punished for doing so); I do see people getting punished for perpetrating injustices against members of groups (and I do see a lot people not getting punished when I think they should); but I don?õ????t see brave truth-tellers getting punished just for telling the truth.

"I'm writing a novel about a white cop shooting an unarmed black man. For realism, what conflicts or plot points should I include?"	"One answer I?õ????m not seeing here is the backstory for these guys. Cops just don?õ????t get up one day and decide, ?õ????I?õ????m going to shoot an unarmed (Black or White) suspect, just because?õ???ù. There?õ????s usually a lot going on behind the scenes which prompt that sort of response from anyone, police officer or not.
For example, maybe this cop was just as idealistic as any rookie when he/she first joined the force. But, after years of patrolling high-crime areas and dealing with the worst society has to offer, that officer becomes jaded or even a bit suspicious when dealing with someone from an identifiable group. Or maybe that officer is a rookie after all and is dealing with the first life-or-death encounter in his entire life; the shooting may be an overreaction to a (rightly or wrongly) perceived threat.
Or maybe there is a large issue with distrust of law enforcement as a whole due to perceived bias constantly being reported in the media. Or maybe there is an issue with the ?õ????us versus them?õ???ù mindset so prevalent in agencies and academies these days. All this can create a dystopian backdrop in which cops tend to ?õ????circle the wagons?õ???ù against perceived attacks from the very public they are sworn to serve and protect.
And let?õ????s not forget the ?õ????Fog of War?õ???ù; this isn?õ????t something only seen on the battlefield. Most civilians have no idea of what it?õ????s like to be in a situation like that. These officers often have mere seconds to make a decision which will eventually be examined for days/weeks/months/sometimes years by the public and/or juries. It?õ????s really easy to to be a ?õ????Monday-morning quarterback?õ???ù when you?õ????re not in the heat of the situation and have only seconds to determine the threat staring you in the face, and we often get the luxury of judging these decisions with information which may very well not have been available to that officer at the time of the shooting.
Also, what is/has been going on in the officers?õ???? personal life? Combat veterans aren?õ????t the only ones who risk suffering from PTSD; just ask any firefighter, EMT, or law enforcement officer. Could the officer?õ????s performance have been thusly affected?
I guess what I?õ????m getting at here is that the story has to go a little deeper than who did/saw/said what to whom. Police shootings are like icebergs; what you see is often only about 1/4 of the entire story, with the other 3/4 hidden beneath the surface. But, when you expose that hidden 3/4 of the story, things which didn?õ????t make a lot of sense or seemed to be done out of maliciousness suddenly start to look really different.

What engineering/applied science degree is for me?	"Hey, Chris from the Mad Scientist Podcast here!
As others have said, if you want to do work in engineering you are going to need to pretty much love physics, since that is all engineering is ultimately haha. Of course certain engineering degrees will require more or less, for instance civil engineering is the most physics probably but chemical engineering is the most chemistry. Anyways, it sounds too me that you would do well in some computer engineering, computer science, or electrical engineering field. These require basic math but then focus mostly on electrical design and things like that. If you prefer programming more than electrical design then I would do a more computer science side one, if you like the cybersecurity section more than go into electrical engineering, etc. You will also likely not touch any of these topics until you get into graduate school!
One good suggestion would be to look at schools you are considering and the course list they have for those particular programs. You can also look at what professors are doing for research in those departments since that will hint at their speciality and what they may be able to help you study as a student.

How can I motivate myself to read more books rather than spending time on the Internet?	"In a nutshell: Learn how to read more books by spending time on the internet. Make the transition easy on yourself.

What are the perks of marrying you?	"A2a
Perks of marrying me? Really hard question. Writing about myself is something I'm not so good at. Last time I answered about myself was during my job interview.
So I asked one of my closest friends what could be the perks of marrying me. I'm copy pasting whatever he wrote.
At this point texted him "" Aww I'm flattered. I'm already flying like Flying Dutchman.""
He replied , ""Catwoman, here goes the last and bonus one.

What are all the negative traits of humans as a species?	"Note preference does not equate to racism. This stems from the time when members of the same race would typically form communities together, mainly because they looked similar. We became biased towards those who look like us because they were typically part of our group and, especially in the neolithic (stone) age, people who were different than you could have been members of a different, and potentially hostile, group. This has stayed with us and been expanded in the form of racism.
Now why does this matter now? Power guarantees freedom. If you are in charge then you are essentially free to do whatever you choose (look at absolute monarchs and Adolf Hitler). People are power hungry because power allows them to be autonomous individuals and breaks the chains of authority that hold them down. In the stone age organized government obviously did not exist, people were fully autonomous agents. We still have an innate desire for freedom which, in the age of bureaucracy , can only be seized by holding positions of power.
This one is rather obvious, just watch the news. In the stone age, the humans who survived were the ones that were selfish. They had enough food to survive and only helped others when they received some benefit from it, such as remaining in the community for protection. Our ancestors mainly passed down the traits for selfishness, because the ones who were truly altruistic died and could not pass down this trait. As a result ?õ????true altruism?õ???ù does not exist, no one does anything unless they get some sort of benefit from it.

"Honestly, do grades matter?"	"I?õ????m going to answer this exactly the same way that I tell my students.
Your grade only really matter for the traditional path and for a small number of research jobs and careers. What matters a lot more is your approach to life:
The thing is that if these are true then students almost always have fairly good grades. These are the things that matter not grades most of the time.
That being said here are the times that grades matter:
Basically grades matter at a few specific instances in time when transitioning between phases in life. Grades can save you a few years of ?õ????catching up?õ???ù but in the long run there are other paths to the same thing that take a little bit longer if you are willing to try.
This is why some high school drop outs succeed. At school they don?õ????t have the correct attitude to life. They fail, hit rock bottom, go through the school of hard knocks and relatively quickly learn and change who they are then succeed without traditional schooling. The grades try (sometimes badly) to reflect what is important.

How would you explain memory from a non-materialist/reductive physicalist point of view?	"One way to look at a memory is as a function of the mind. The mind creates stories, concepts, beliefs, thoughts, and a memory is one of those stories. This explanation of memory takes into account the linear passage of time, from past, through present, into the future.
Another explanation of memory suggests itself when one accounts for time being no more but how mind organizes its perceptions. If time does not exist outside of the mind then the mind does perceive everything it perceives now, then everything that happens does happen now, then what is called ?õ????memory?õ???ù is an awareness of something that happens now but maybe is only glimpsed ?õ????off the conner of mind?õ????s eye?õ???ù as the main attention of the mind is focused on what it considers to be be the main event ?õ????now?õ???ù.

When was a time that you got exactly what you wanted but still were unhappy?	"(In
*Phone rings at & 6.45 a.m*
Now this is something similar to what Navaneet has written. I was born and raised in U.A.E. In between I spent 5 years in Hyderabad, India. All that while I always wanted to get back to
My job started, it was challenging but things started to get better eventually. All the excitement subsided. I realized something is missing in life. I would get all the scrumptious food in the world (Im a die hard foodie) & would have my own money to spend, all sorts of comfort & just everything I need right in place.
But certain even better things in my life were nowhere to be seen. No eating junk on the streets with friends. No planning out matching outfits. No spending hours to decide where to hangout the next day. No calling friends to ask?õ???ùHow much did you study??õ???ù. No worries when you would not have a single penny in your pocket because you knew your friends had your back. No constant trash talking/gossiping.
Yes I do have friends now. But there is no essence. Nothing is the same.
Right now I have a job, I am well educated, all independent & bold. I had all the material things and it was not too late to realize little things matter the most. Simple things matter the most in life.
(P.s I had always been an introvert and the only daughter to my parents. And I had selected but amazing friends who were never any less than family to me. I could never be any more grateful for having them in my life)

Why do people still use ships to ship things instead of airplanes?	"Because it is ridiculously cheap to transport cargo by ship. How cheap is modern shipping? It is so cheap, Scottish fisheries actually save money shipping their cod fish to China for processing
Plain old container shipping is even cheaper. At today?õ????s rate, it costs about US$450 to transport a one TEU (twenty-foot equivalent) container from Los Angeles to Shanghai.
This is a typical TEU container.
How much can you store in a TEU container? Roughly 20 metric tons of cargo if you pack it to max weight allowance (^45,000 lbs). How much is that in every day weight comparison? That's about 13 Toyota Camrys (ignoring volume).
So for US$450, you can ship the equivalent weight of 13 Camrys across 6,500 miles of ocean.
And this cost keeps getting cheaper because container liners are building ever larger container ships. The current record holder is the MSC Oscar class of container ships with a carrying capacity of 19,200 TEUs.
This bad boy is one of the largest ocean going vessels ever built.
The handy chart below shows some fun facts of the carrying capacity equivalence for the MSC Oscar:

What is the misinterpretation of the number 666 that makes people think it is the number of the Devil?	"Says the Apocalypse that the beast could say greatness and blasphemies by 42 months, adding that their number was 666. We can take each month as being 30 years, obtaining, a period of 1260 years, precisely the period between 610 and 1870 A.D., when the Papacy was consolidated, after his birth, with the emperor Phocas, in 607, and the decree of papal infallibility with Pius IX, in 1870, which noted the decadence and absence of authority of the Vatican, in face of evolution scientific, philosophical and religious of Humanity.
The number 666. We must to search to roman numerals, explaining that is the Supreme Pontiff of the roman church who uses the titles of VICARIVS GENERALIS DEI IN TERRIS, VICARIVS FILII DEI and DVX CLERI meaning Vicar General of God on Earth, Vicar of the Son of God and Prince of the Clergy. It will suffice for the scholar a little game of patience, adding the roman numerals found in each papal title to find the same equation of 666, in each one of them.

How have psychedelics positively and negatively affected people?	"There is is some research in this domain. Go to google scholar and look it up if you are really interested in the scientific research.
But from the point of view of a pranic healer, I can tell you it is a bad idea to do drugs. Hallucinogens burn holes in the protective webs of the chakras. Those holes have to be repaired by a energy healer, they don't just close up on their own. So the damage can be more or less permanent. When a person has holes in these protective webs, they can see/hear/feel/experience non physical things. They have no control over their emotions or their experiences, and this can be unpleasant. They are at risk of being contaminated by dirty energy, diseased energy, negative thought forms, negative emotions, negative elementals and other beings. Without treatment, these problems tend to get worse.

What is the one golden thing you want to do in life?	"A longing thing I need to do in my life.. I dream to.. I long to.. I really wanted to.. Soulfully..
My parents had a own house inaugurated to live a happy life in 1990 when my sister was studying some 5th or 6th and I was an year old baby.
Its my paternal grandpa's property to my dad.
It was a wonderful house with ancient day building style.
It had one bigggg hall which can accommodate 90-100 to sit, a room, a bigggg kitchen where some 200 can sit on the floor, bathroom with biggg tank inside which can store 1000 liters where the corporation water directly gets into it. So no need of buckets as it was ancient style.
I used to sit on my mom?õ????s lap and play in patio during evenings leisurely. A very big patio.
As being Christians, we had habit of sharing fruits, sweets for New Year to neighbors and relatives. Still I remember, from Dec 20th to Dec 31st, my mom will be busy preparing kilos and kilos of snacks (muruku, athirasam, somasa, laddu, gulab jamum,etc) and we store around 100 kgs of fruits like apple, mosambi and banana. We put a pack with a dozen banaza, 1 kg mosambi, 1 kg apple, a cake box and mixture of all homemade snacks and make it ready to share with others on Jan 1st.
I can still see in my mind how the house was during those New Year time with all eatables for the celebration, how grand we lived, how much we helped all.
I might be studying around 1st or 2nd standard. Daily early morning when my mom gets up to clean the doorstep to put rangoli, she will see a shirt/cloth dipped in turmeric and an half-cut lemon applied with kum-kum kept in my dad?õ????s scooter (bajaj Scooter in 1990 itself - grey color).
Many financial problems were there and with a prayer held in our home, we came to know witch crafts were done for us before residing into the house. As per the priest?õ????s advice we dug the steps where there will be the door mat and we put our slippers near by.
There we found a copper metal sheet with some some dolls sculpted on it. We were terribly shocked. Through the prayers, it was known, witches were done by my dad?õ????s brothers. But they smile & talk with us as good persons. We are unable to believe. Then the Priest blessed the house and left. Consecutively many bad things happened and finally went bankruptcy which made to sell our beautiful house. I was sold for 5 lakhs in 1995. (Hope, now the property can cost a crore. Its a palace really!)
As the house was in due, we vacated the house in early morning, which I still remember. We were given place in my dad?õ????s sister?õ????s house for few months. Then we changed around 4?õ????5 houses due to rent issues. After few years, my dad expired with illness.
I know and have seen the pain my parents felt carrying the things on their shoulders to change every house. We lived like king in a palace like house. I know how my mom lived in our house and how lived in rent house. I saw her crying many sleepless nights thinking about not having a place to stay and with narrow, thorny paths, she made us & its what I and my sister are now. (I?õ????m an Engineer, she is a Teacher )
We were brought up by our maternal grandpa who is the savior of our life. The BE degree which I have now, is given by my grandpa. The post ?õ????Testing engineer?õ???ù I have right now is the credit for my grandpa and my mom?õ????s hard-work and sleepless crying nights.
We have to cross that way (our old own house) to reach our Parish church. I have seen my mom crying many times on seeing that house. Its crushed and altered now. I?õ????ll say ?õ????amma, its no more our house. Hold on.. Time will come for us?õ???ù. As she felt much grieves, we chose alternative way to reach church and it had been several years not using that way.
Still we have no own place to reside in. Both daughters married. Grandpa expired in 2014. My mom is now with grandma which is my maternal uncle?õ????s house. After grandma?õ????s life, we are clueless where my Mom will reside. Probably in a rent house, we?õ????ll take care of her for sure.
I can feel tears standing in queue behind my eyes to rush out while writing this. I can feel the pain in throat for controlling tears thinking on how my mom struggled to make us who we are today.
Thanks for reading a chapter of my life!

It was during the (STATIC) State Test. Session Two. Two hours of boredom, locked in a classroom with only you, your pencil, the desk, other kids and a book to read once you're done. Reminds me of prison-
During the middle of the test, I pulled out a tissue. My nose was running. That wasn't bad, I made it through. But that was when?õ????

Those agendas are undisclosed, and veiled as investigative integrity, the oportunities of honest conversation is ruined, and systemic damages are incurred by society. Saul Alinsky mastered the strategy, one of a long line of treacherous thinkers.
I will start a partial answer to this by outlining some valid sectors that have in many cases become corrupted and captured to act as false authorities. News media. Religious platforms. Governmental boreaucracies. Educators. Business.
Intellectual and information sharing forums.
In the end, we all have to decide for ourselves, as did Pontius Pilate, what we will do with the Truth that stands so evidently before us.

First, I don?õ????t call conservatives ?õ????deplorables?õ???ù, and I don?õ????t know any liberals who do. I?õ????ll thank you not to conflate supporters of 45 or Monster Ryan with real conservatives. Real conservatives are compassionate and believe in things like facts and science.

What do you do when your father is just impossible?	"I have a sad story to tell you all and before I ask you guys for suggestions regarding my current problem, i want to give you a little background about my life. My mother expired when I was 18 and since then, I and my father have been having arguments. While I was growing up, I never saw my father take good care of my mother. They had very bad arguments. My father would call my mother fat, he would fight with her for issues as small as not cooking good food and what not. I also know that my mother had depression because she was a housewife and she couldn?õ????t share all this with her family as my father didn?õ????t like my mother talking about husband-wife matters to her family. Honestly, more than good days - i saw my mom go through bad days. And one fine day, she had brain hemorrhage and she was no more.
I hated my father but i still respected him - as he was my ?õ????father?õ????. He then started creating problems for me like he wouldn?õ????t allow me to hang out with my friends, he would force me to pray, he hated me for having a boyfriend and all this was just miserable. My father never spoke enough to me. Never loved me.
I was so tired of going through all of this, that one fine day - I ran to my aunts place. I stayed with her for 2 months and then came back home again. My father was better with me for few months. And again during my post-graduation - he again started torturing me - he would yell and scream at me for having a boyfriend, he would ask questions like if I have slept with the guy, he would check my phone every now and then, search my room etc. I was all innocent in fact. I didn?õ????t want to affect my studies and I wanted to be happy and this time - i asked my aunt to come home and take me away from this place. My aunt hates my dad. She came to my house, asked my dad if she can take her for few days to our hometown. There was a huge fight between my aunt, her husband and my dad but eventually I left my dad never to return.
Fast forward 4 years. As a sincere daughter, I wanted to take blessings of my father before tying knot with my boyfriend. I kept everything aside and went to him. He was happy I came home. But he disapproved of my boyfriend. Even though there are no caste problems. My bf is a non-vegetarian and that?õ????s why my father wouldn?õ????t marry me to him. My father trusts everyone else but not me.
I just don?õ????t know what to do, on one hand i always come back to him because he?õ????s my father and I feel guilty that I shouldn?õ????t do such a thing to him. On the other hand, he has always hurt me - by not taking care of my mother, by not trusting outsiders more than me, by never appreciating me..

Adult Webcam: Is there a way to know if you're being recorded or captured on Chatturbate?	"Unfortunately it's pretty much impossible to know whether or not someone is recording or capturing your live feed. For example, when Snapchat knows that someone has recorded one of your snaps - for example by taking a screen shot - it's because their App is installed on the person's phone. Through the App, they have access to the person's file system and can know pretty much what's going on there.
In Chaturbate case it's happening on a browser, which renders impossible to know what's happening on the person's computer (a browser behaves like a sandbox). In order to know like Snapchat, they'd need to ask every viewer to download and install an App - which they are obviously not gonna do - and even then it would not be pretty effective: anyone could record your show from a camera etc.
The only thing chaturbate could do is finding content of yours which have been illegally recorded and uploaded back onto the internet - for example to tube sites. They could also find who is the user responsible for this.
In order to achieve such a result they'd need to send a different video feed to every single viewer in your room (with an invisible watermark), parse the internet to find your videos and identify the source via the watermark - if it has not been removed. That would be a big tech, expensive and a big hassle for pretty much no results: even then they could not take much action against the member: they don't have his ID or anything to make enforcing the law likely in real life.
I'm afraid the only proper answer to people recording your shows and possibly uploading them online is to watermark your content (this can be done via streaming softwares) so that at least whenever it happens you get ""free promotion"".
On the more fortunate side, there are some techs incoming which will render recording much harder than it is currently: you can look for DRM techs (digital right management). It should take a couple of years most likely though.

What is the message of the poem Badoc written by Carlos Angeles?	"Thanks for asking!
I will comment on?õ???? time. Time could very well be a major theme (and possibly message) of said poem. From words like ?õ????continuing or beginning?õ???ù to statements directly involving time, it seems that the author has chosen plant life to be their canvass for the element of time.
Time effects all things, and defiance of it is ultimately doomed to failure, hence ?õ????tragic?õ???ù. Time makes things grow and makes things die. Ultimately everything has a time, and then indifferently, time moves on from it all.
That?õ????s my take- perhaps an over-simplification, but I hope it helps!

What are the best places to eat in Kanpur?	"Woah! I am feel i am eligible to answer this question. Being born and bought up there have checked out plenty of good joints to eat.
To start with would love to name street food and low in budget but high on taste places. If you want to eat chat try the joint named ?õ????the chat?õ???? at swaroop nagar area. For yummy momos visit chaudhary momos at naveen market lane no 2. If you are a non veg fan enjoy lunch at rakesh biryani at pared because he serves only from 12noon to 2pm. Then you can visit swaroop nagar for frankies at a place called aromas and also its own version of pizzas. You can also enjoy khasta and kachoris in front of madhuraj hospital at swaroop nagar in a small shop named bacchan lal ki kachori.
If you are a non veg lover kanpur is a boon for you, enjoy tikka rice at energy store,chicken n mutton stew with kababs at baba biryani and you cant miss out on delicious crispy kababs at makkhan singh served with special chutney, all these joints happen to be at swaroop nagar itself. You can also visit govindnagar for ?õ????anil ka meat?õ???? which is deliciously yummy.
Also a restaurent named ?õ????treat?õ???? at naveen market is one of the oldest and serves all kinds of cuisines and is a spot for american softy.
For pure vegetarians restaurent named pandits is a blessing, which serves everything cooked in desi ghee. Its in cantt area.
For typical rajasthani food you can visit chokho marwar which is on top of pandits.
To enjoy aunthentic chinese you must defintly try ?õ????shang hai?õ???? at mall road and also ?õ????chung fa?õ???? you wont be disappointed for sure.
For upper end restaurents a visit to quality restaurent at mall road is a must, its butter chicken is a recomendation.
Also, places like landmark, dhuaan, rave3 mall, cawnpore club, etc offer various restaurents where you can enjoy a splendid time with awsome food.
If tou want to gorge on desserts visit thaggu ke laddu for its famous laddus and badnaam kulfi at bada chauraha, try banarsi k laddu at birhana road, shop named bansiwala serves fabulous sweets at raina market. Ghosh mishthan bhandar for its mishti doi and other bengali sweets. You can try upper crust bakery for various cakes and bakery products and its walnut pie is my personal favourite. Also a special dessert which you get only in winters is malai makkhan which you can find on d streets of birhana road. Fruit cream and malai makkhan in front of madhuraj hospital at swaroop nagar.
When you done with all this and you feel an urge to have chaye you must visit banarsi chaye wala at 80feet road.
For further treat visit ladies pan centre at mall road or monkey pan shop in front of hallet hospital for the best pan (betel) experiences ever.
I think i should stop with this answer here and head to eat something.
Hope this helps, else i have other joints as well.

What kind of a TV show/Web Series do you desire to be made on the Indian Railways?	"I'm my opinion the shows or Web series on how things work in Indian Railways should be made.
Documentary on how a railway engine works, how signalling system works, how to drive a locomotive, what are the general technical specs of an engine, how the scheduling of trains is done. These kind of shows should be made. The information related to the various departments of Indian Railways should be revealed. In case of Web series questions from viewers should be answerd along with a full dedicated episode of it.
So in other words overall technical as well as management related information revealing shows or Web series should be made.

Is German language required for working in Germany?	"Definitly a yes.
Even though a lot of Germans can speak english, there are enough that are not as comfortable or confident to listen to english, and even less to speak it. Especially if there are more colleages around them, able to listen to them speak english.
So partly, it is not because of you, but because Germans want to be perfect, moreso professional in the working business. So they can?õ????t afford a weakness, in this case, being not 100% accurate in the pronounciation of business english.
Also, cultur wise. Germany does like the english language, but it is still Germany. And Germans like German more. Germans want to give work to most of the people, but they want them to learn German. This means, you might be able to get a job with knowing just a couple of words in German, but your goal must be, to be able to speak German down the road. It is an act of respect, not just to the German people, but to the country, that you will honor, by learning the language.
I have been in many businesses in Germany, and a lot are working international. So it is required to be able to speak english, if your position requires to work international. But for working in the company, German is the language used.
There are, of course, exceptions.

What will parenting in 2080 be like?	"If there is a supreme being of any kind, and hopefully even if there is not, some form of instantaneous transport will exist.
The basics of teaching your kids to be civil, social, self-functioning, etc. will all still exist. However, instantaneous transport would solve many of the most frustrating issues confronting many parents today:
And last, but not least, this one so important that I will give it its own paragraph rather than add it to the list above: the restoration of the multi-family dynamic for all who wish it.
I think my eldest was all of three days old when I observed that this mode we have today in the US where you grow up, go to college, end up settling afar from your roots, and then have children with no nearby source of family support or assistance is
It?õ????s true that sometimes managing expectations of other interested parties can present an additional challenge, but when I compare the experience of my friends who have local family to support them with my own experience and the experience of my friends who do not ?õ???? there is no comparison in the amount of parenting stress that can be relieved simply by having some family that are local.
From the child?õ????s point of view it is different as well, at least in my case ?õ???? I had one pair of local grandparents, and one pair distantly located. Although I valued both relationships, as an adult I can say that my relationship with the local grandparents feels as though it was a more knowing relationship, me of them and they of me. They contributed to my worldview and my growth in a way that the distant grandparents did not.

What would happen if the whole world was gay?	"Two things.
Less people will be complaining, and so most governments may be able to focus more on improvement of the nations. World Peace finally attained, maybe?õ????
But that would be otherwise if humans would be gay up to the extent of being carefree.
Image source:
Eventually, most poor people will be the last of their generation, as they wouldn?õ????t be able to afford such procedure, until such time that this procedure will be developed to be cheaper.
Other than the change of sexual preference of people, there will be no much change.
There might be a change on the demand of some goods and services, but since I do not know if which goods and services will be affected, I could not assume some things. But definitely, there will be an increase in demand on the artificial insemination as most people still want a child but would stay away from copulation with the opposite sex.
But there are also some cases where both gay male and female still get married, thus they still have the ability to procreate.
Bottom line, there will be no much change in the world.

What are SAP MDG interview questions?		
What does 666 signify?	"The mark of the beast, 666, is a reference to the treasury of Solomon (2 Chr 9.13, cf 1 Kng 10.14; cf Josephus,
This is the single largest personal fortune recorded in the Old Testament, and represents Solomon's annual intake of treasure. It is an enormous quantity of gold.
Placed on the forehead or hands, the Mark is a parody of Israel's Shema (Deut 6.6-8):
In the Revelation of John, these two references together represent the idolatry of money, people who worship money and power rather than Israel's God:
This is why 666 is used as a number to contrast those marked out as part of God's ""true"" Israel, numbering 144,000, in Revelation. In Revelation, 666 and 144 are used to symbolically distinguish between the suffering righteous and the idolatrous wicked.
One of the earliest controversies in the early church revolved around this number. According to Irenaeus there were some who favored the number 616 and used gematria--a method for numerical calculation popular in Jewish mysticism--to arrive at the name of an emperor. Irenaeus rejected this approach and used a different method as a solution, looking for similar numbers in scripture.
According to New Testament scholar Richard Bauckham, the ""gematria"" solution--rejected almost immediately by church authorities in the second century--was revived by German scholars in 1831. Scholars have been squabbling about which emperor it must refer to--the names Nero and Caligula in particular can both equal 666--ever since.
Gematria is an especially shortsighted answer that ignores the exegetical techniques of the early church and relies on a method of interpretation for which there is no evidence in scriptures--no other puzzle in scripture, not even in Revelation, requires gematria for resolution.

How do I show or add to my leadership skills so that I can benefit while taking admission in some very reputed MBA universities across the globe?	"You mean how can you develop leadership skills. It's already there, in you. You don't need to add it, you just need to give it a little push.
No one is a born leader?õ????everyone can develop leadership skills and
everyone can benefit from using them.
First, take time to honestly analyze yourself.
Learn to understand yourself. It?õ????s the first step to understanding others.
Consider these important questions:
1. What kind of leader am I? One who helps solve problems? A leader
who helps people get along? How do others see me as a leader?
2. What are my goals, purposes, and expectations in working with
this particular group?
Identify areas for improvement. Ask yourself these questions:
1. Do I try to be aware of how others think and feel?
2. Do I try to help others perform to the best of their abilities?
3. Am I willing to accept responsibility?
4. Am I willing to try new ideas and new ways of doing things?
5. Am I able to communicate with others effectively?
6. Am I a good problem solver?
7. Do I accept and appreciate other perspectives and opinions?
8. Am I aware of current issues and concerns on campus or in my
community?
Then--after analyzing your strengths and weaknesses--take action.
Devise a strategy for upgrading your skills. Here are a few strategies to
consider:
1)
created by speaking down to people, asking closed questions that elicit yes or no
answers, using excessive authority, and promoting a culture that depends on
unanimity. If your focus is winning the argument or if you react defensively to
criticism, you?õ????ll create fear of openness and hinder the organization?õ????s growth.
Try these steps to effective communication:
?õ???õ Listen actively-ask open questions. Be genuinely interested in what other?õ????s say
?õ???õ Thank people for their openness--stress how much you value it--even if you don?õ????t like
specifically what is being said.
?õ???õ Point to areas of agreement before jumping on areas of disagreement-this reduces
defensiveness; members wont fear being ?õ????attacked.?õ???ù
?õ???õ Set aside your authority to create an atmosphere of partnership to reduce fear in
group members.
?õ???õ Promote a culture of constructive dissent-though not to the point of paralysis.
?õ???õ Portray disagreement as simply a difference of opinion. Get rid of the ?õ????I?õ????m right,
you?õ????re wrong?õ???ù attitude.
2)
?õ???õ Friendliness: others will be more willing to share ideas if you?õ????re interested in them as
people too.
?õ???õ Understanding: everyone makes mistakes. Try to be constructive, tolerant and
tactful when offering criticism.
?õ???õ Fairness: equal treatment and equal opportunity lead to an equally good effort from
all group members.
?õ???õ Integrity: members will take tasks more seriously if you show that you?õ????re more
interested in group goals than your own personal gain.
3) Keep everyone working toward agreed upon goals:
?õ???õ Remind everyone of the group?õ????s purposes from time to time. It?õ????s easy to become too
narrowly focused and lose sight of the larger goals.
?õ???õ Provide encouragement and motivation, by showing your appreciation for good
ideas and extra effort.
?õ???õ Harmonize differences and disagreements between group members by stressing
compromise and cooperation.
?õ???õ Involve everyone in discussions and decisions, even if asking for opinions and ideas
means a longer discussion.
4)
Everyone has different abilities, wants, needs, and purpose in life. To get along with
others and get results, you need to get to know them.
?õ???õ Interact with group members as often as possible. The only way to get to know
someone is through direct personal contact.
?õ???õ Become familiar with every member of your group. Take note of each person?õ????s
unique qualities and characteristics.
5)
Put your knowledge and understanding of each group member to work!
?õ???õ Be aware of expectations. Everyone expects something different: recognition, a
chance to learn, a chance to work with other people, etc.
?õ???õ Be creative. A repetitious routine can cause boredom. A successful leader thinks of
new and better approaches to old ways of doing things.
?õ???õ Provide rewards. Recognition by the group is a source of personal satisfaction and
positive reinforcement for a job well done.
?õ???õ Delegate responsibilities. If everyone shares the work, everyone can share pride in
the group?õ????s accomplishments. Let each member know what?õ????s expected of him/her,
available resources, deadlines, etc.
6)
?õ???õ Take the initiative. Why stand around and wait for someone else to get things
started? Set an example.
?õ???õ Offer help and information. Your unique knowledge and skills may be just what?õ????s
needed.
?õ???õ Seek help and information. Ask for advice if you need it. This will encourage group
involvement and help accomplish group goals.
?õ???õ Make things happen. By being decisive, energetic, and enthusiastic, you can and will
help get things done!
?õ???õ Know when and how to say ?õ????no.?õ???ù If your time and resources are already committed,
turn down extra tasks, but do it nicely.
7)
Whether you are faced with a decision to make or a conflict to resolve, following a
logical approach will help.
1. State the problem as simply and clearly as possible.
2. Gather all relevant information and available resources.
3. Brainstorm as many ideas or solutions as you can think of (with others if
possible).
4. Evaluate each idea or solution and choose the best one.
5. Design a plan for using your idea or solution. Include a timetable, assigned roles,
and resources to be used.
6. Follow up on your plan by asking if your idea worked and why or why not.
All the best.

How much does an average IITan study in a day?		
What careers are in demand in 2017?	"A straight forward answer to this can be- Whatever you are extremely good at.
Although, if you are haven?õ????t made up your mind yet, following can be the choices in which you can make good amount of money if you excel in the skill required:
1.) Cloud Computing: Since the entire world has moved online now, all the data of big corporations are stored over cloud network. From Snapchat to Wall-Mart, they all use cloud services of google or amazon to store their data, which explains the demand for this job as later on, every company is gonna need its own cloud.
2.) HFT or Algo trader: As against popular belief, the job of a trader is going to get tougher because of the efficiency brought in by use of advance technology in stock market. Therefore, high frequency trader or Algo traders will be the people skimming the profit from the market first.
3.) Mathematician: A good mathematician with depth knowledge is valuable everywhere from finance to research to economics. A mathematics degree from a good College, probably Ivy League, can fetch you a job in any field you want. Neither the stock market nor the government can run without number crunching.
4.) Management Consultant: This comes in the list in prospect of growing businesses and start-ups in India, who are eventually going to screw up and going to need your expert consultancy to save their drowning ship.
5.) Doctor: This is an essential profession that every society needs, but right now, it needs them the most because India is growing along with many other emerging nations, where the living standard is rising and people are getting more concerned about their health and trust me, they should be if they want to celebrate their 50th birthday.

And yes, very soon in the future, even the Dentists will be able to earn enough because very soon people are going to realise that the salt in their tooth paste doesn?õ????t actually work.
These are only the broad main stream fields. Some other professions that can give good returns are Marketing and Advertisement Consultancy, Content Writing, renewable energy/alternative energy researcher and automobile engineering.

"Which city is better for young expat professionals in finance, Hong Kong or Singapore?"	"It really depends, but if you have passion and ambition and want to change the world, then Hong Kong is much better than Singapore.
The thing about Singapore is that it?õ????s run by the Singaporean government. The Singaporean government does an excellent job of running Singapore, but that means that as an expat, you are going to be operating within the policies of the Singapore government. These are good policies, but you don?õ????t have the ability to tell the government ?õ????look I think you?õ????ve got it all wrong?õ???ù and expect to have people take you seriously.
The thing about HK is that the government is much, much weaker so its possible for a small number of people or even one person to make a huge difference. Because Singapore is run by the government, there?õ????s very little that you can do to change Singapore. By contrast, I know of individuals that have radically changed HK by doing or not doing certain things.
The thing about Singapore is that if you ask me what Singapore is going to look like in 10 or 20 years, I can give you a good answer. If you ask me what Hong Kong is going to look like in 10 or 20 years, I haven?õ????t got a clue, and I can imagine scenarios in which Hong Kong becomes heaven or hell. The reason I can?õ????t tell you is that what HK turns into depends on what you and I do, and the fact that you really can make a difference is why I think for someone with a need for adventure, HK is far, far better than Singapore.

Really not different from back when musicians were musicians and had to tour, and had opening acts. It was a way for a bigger act to cultivate new fans by getting other people to show up at shows, and obviously it was a huge opportunity for the smaller opening act. Now, they just do it on singles.

What is meant by the frequency of photons?	"OK?õ???? let me explain. I am going to do something questionable here and make an assumption about what you are thinking when you ask this question. I apologize for doing what I warn my own students against?õ???? assuming that I can say what the thoughts of another person are. But I have seen similar questions where I could query the asker, and there has been a common thread.
I suspect that your question arises from a misunderstanding of the role of photons in describing light. Basically you may have been told or inferred that light is ?õ????really made of photons?õ???ù, and therefore expect all the properties of light to be reducible to photon terms. Hence questions like ?õ????what is meant by the frequency of a photon?õ???ù. This is not at all your fault, and indeed you clearly see that there is a problem with this, hence your question!
Now, notice, that the question I just stated, about ?õ????the frequency of a photon?õ???ù is not in fact what you asked! So you may, in fact, be aware that this question is not really answerable. Interestingly it
The problem with asking about the frequency of a photon is that light, like other things, can be described as having a
It?õ????s one or the other. If you create a situation where the particle aspects of light are relevant then those photons have energy and momentum. If you create a situation where the wave aspects of light are to the fore then those electromagnetic fields have frequency and wavelength. But you can?õ????t squeeze those aspects together into one simultaneous description.
If you have read about or studied quantum mechanics you may be able to relate this best to the idea of a wave function. A wave function is distributed in space and does not have a particular well defined position etc. Under many circumstances it is the wave function we look to to explain the behaviour of things?õ???? for example when we fire electrons at a double slit it is the wave function we would examine to predict the interference pattern that will emerge after. When the wave function interacts with a system that is complex and which requires localization (such as the screen that wills how where the electron its) then it will interact with that system at a point, and will be ?õ????seen?õ???? as a particle, which does have a well defined position. One way to describe this is that the wave function ?õ????collapses?õ???ù to a single point (a electron particle). That electron did not exist as a particle (or at least did not act like a particle) prior to the interaction, and so many physicists would say that it did not have particle properties. Only after the ?õ????collapse of the wave function?õ???ù does it have those.
Now, the electromagnetic field
This is not at all what Planck had in mind when he described his radiation law E=h
So why might it be more meaningful to ask about the frequency of a group of photons? Well, groups of particles can manifest properties that an individual particle does not. A ?õ????group of photons?õ???ù can even have mass, though no photon does. And similarly there are some circumstances where a group of photons (or if you prefer a wave packet) could have both wave aspects and particle aspects (to some extent)?õ???? though notice that the price for doing this is for the frequency to no longer be well defined as a single number. And this leads back to QM again, and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relations and so on.

"If Ishmael is the chosen son, why did God perform a miracle for Sarah at age 100?"	"This is a ""begging the question"" logical fallacy, since at no point does Allah say that Ishmael was ""the"" chosen son implying that the other son would be restricted from prophethood perks & abilities. In fact, in the Qur'an God does confirm both brothers as prophets and righteous men, so they were both chosen.
Also the question doesn't make sense, since there were numerous biblical figures that were allowed to perform miracles, so how was Sarah's miracle somehow proof that Ishmael couldn't have been chosen?

Should I opt for a blow dryer or a straightener?	"Dear its like asking coffee or tea?
Yes both are hot bewerage and both can be used as a good conversation starter or just to buddy up while reading your favourite novel but if it's coffee or tea is one?õ????s own personal choice.
Similarly the use of blowdryer and straighteners are different however can be used together as well if you need a specific touch to your hairstyle.
Straightener and blowdryer both use heat to mould your hair into a desired touch.
Straighteners as the name suggest turns curly or wavy hair to straight while blowdryer tends to add volume (creates illusion of volume) to your hair and is suitable if you are looking for a quiff . Often you can use both and if you have wavy hair but prefer straight touch to quiff you can use both.
All in all it depends on the hairstyle you want then you can pick hair straighteners or blowdryer or maybe both.

How can I become a pilot?	"Steps to Become an Aircraft Pilot-
Individuals interested in becoming an aircraft pilot will first need to determine what type of aircraft they want to fly. The FAA offers several types of pilot's licenses, including private pilot, recreational pilot, and sports pilot. The types of aircraft that people fly include airplanes, helicopters, balloons, airships, and gliders.
Next, aspiring aircraft pilots need to attend an FAA-certified flight school or take private lessons from an FAA-certified instructor. These programs may be found at flight training schools, community colleges, and technical schools. Topics covered include basic aerodynamics, aircraft components, and flight controls, FAA regulations, aircraft weight and balance, basic navigation, flight planning, and aircraft systems. Every hour of training and flight instruction is logged to ensure new pilots have completed the minimum hours needed to learn how to fly an airplane.
Along with a minimum amount of flight hours, students need to demonstrate sufficient skills and knowledge to their flight instructor before they may earn an FAA private pilot's license. This license, also known as a certificate, will allow them to fly an aircraft and carry passengers and baggage without compensation. Individuals will need to earn a commercial pilot's license to get paid to transport people and property.
To earn a private pilot's license, individuals must be at least 17 years old. Private glider pilots or free flight balloon operators must be at least 16. An FAA medical certificate is required. Aspiring pilots must pass a written exam and complete at least 40 hours of flight training. Half of this training must be with a flight instructor, and at least 10 hours must be in solo flight time. A practical flight test is also required.
In order to be compensated for transporting people and property, pilots should obtain a commercial license. Applicants must be 18 years or older. While in training, students should be prepared to keep detailed logs of both their in-flight hours as well as their on-ground hours. Students should reference the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARS) for specific requirements. In order to receive a commercial pilot's license, students must pass a variety of exams, including both a medical and physical exam (pilots must have 20/20 vision or employ corrective eye wear), a comprehensive written exam, and a flight exam where students can demonstrate their practical knowledge of flying an aircraft. Once pilots have obtained their license, they must pass regular physical screenings and practical flight tests in order to keep the status of the license up-to-date. Commercial pilot licenses apply to airplanes, balloons, helicopters, and other aircraft.
Individuals with a private pilot's license may seek employment as a pilot. According to job postings for aircraft pilots, employers seek pilots to test new aircraft, develop flight simulation programs, and conduct national security missions. Employers preferred pilots with several years of flight experience and various pilot licenses.
Aspiring aircraft pilots should consider a degree program. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), most pilots employed by airline companies hold a bachelor's degree; the degree can be in any subject. Some universities even have 2- to 4-year aviation programs that provide training for aspiring pilots.
Regarding promotion, airline pilots follow a ranking system, much like that of officers in the army, that requires pilots to gain years of experience in order to advance. Entry level pilots must have up to 5 years of experience before qualifying for a position as a first officer, the next rank in line. Becoming a captain, the next rank after officer, may take another 5 to 10 years of experience. Captains may then take higher level positions that branch out of the seniority system, such as chief pilot or director of the aviation department for an airline.

Why do men sometimes race a woman to open the door for her when they don't know her?	"I can't say I've ever raced to open a door for a woman, but I've certainly opened and held one if they're just a little bit behind me. If there are 2 doors, I usually let them get the next one, and they're usually polite enough to hold that one open for me too. If the woman is elderly, I might put that extra pep in my step just to help her out a little, or wait a little longer with a door I'm holding open, but other than that, if you're far ahead or lagging too far behind me, you're on your own.
I'm not one of those people who think opening a door for someone is lifting such a weight off their shoulders that they should really appreciate or even reciprocate my gesture. It's just a fucking door, and most of them have those wheelchair accessible motors that will open for you if you press a button anyways. To me, opening a door for someone is one of the few nice gestures a stranger can perform for another stranger, and that's about the long and short of it. It's just nice when you can help someone else you don't even know, even if your help only amounts to a small gesture like being a human door stop.

What happen when a non-diabetic person takes metformin daily for decreasing the weight?	"Not much other then the usual side effects like stomach cramps and diarrhea, which occurs less when on starts low and slowly ups the dose to full dose that is twice daily 1,000 mg.

Is metformin effective for weight loss?
According to findings of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 34.9% of adults aged 20 years or over are obese (body mass index [BMI] ?õ???ù30 kg/m2).[1]
Obesity is a risk factor for many chronic diseases but is best known for its role in metabolic syndrome, which can lead to type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as cardiovascular disease.
Metformin is the first-line pharmacologic treatment for patients with T2D and can be useful in preventing or delaying diabetes in patients with prediabetes, defined as a glycated hemoglobin (A1c) from 5.7% to 6.4%.[2]
Metformin is a valuable treatment for the majority of patients with T2D due its high rate of efficacy, low risk for hypoglycemia, few side effects, ease of use, and low cost.[2]
Additionally, metformin has beneficial effects on weight loss in T2D and possibly in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and obesity without diabetes. The only approved indication for metformin is T2D; thus, most of the understanding of the effect of metformin on weight loss has been gained from research in patients with T2D.[3]
The mechanism of action for metformin is unique compared with other antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases the production of glucose in the liver, decreases the absorption of glucose in the intestine, and improves insulin sensitivity through increasing muscle glucose uptake and use.[3]
Metformin induces weight loss most likely through a loss of adipose tissue[4]
rather than a change in energy expenditure, as is seen with exercise.
Two large studies by the Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group assessed weight loss with metformin. In the study published in 2009, patients randomly assigned to receive lifestyle treatment initially lost weight but gradually regained the lost weight over the 10-year follow-up period. Patients randomly assigned to receive metformin lost less weight at the beginning of the study (2.5 kg) but were able to sustain the weight loss over 10 years.[5]
In the study published in 2012, participants in the original study were offered the chance to continue metformin in an open-label fashion. Overall weight loss during the open label period of 7-8 years was 1.9 kg. In patients considered highly adherent to metformin, the average weight loss was 3.1 kg compared with baseline.[6]
In a study comparing metformin, exercise (about 190 minutes per week), and the combination of the two in adults with impaired glucose tolerance (T2D patients excluded), metformin and metformin plus exercise decreased body weight more than exercise alone. Metformin alone also decreased caloric intake but not percent body fat or central body fat.[7]
Women with PCOS have a higher risk of developing diabetes compared with women of similar age and weight. Metformin has been used off label in PCOS to prevent diabetes and increase ovulation through weight loss.[8]
In a recent randomized controlled trial comparing metformin, oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), and the combination of the two in patients with PCOS without T2D, metformin alone or with OCPs decreased weight and BMI. The median decrease in weight with metformin at 12 months was 3 kg (25th and 75th quartiles; -10.3, 0.6). OCP use was associated with increased weight changes of 1.2 kg (25th and 75th quartiles; -0.8, 3.0), and the combination decreased weight by 1.9 kg (25th and 75th quartiles; -4.9, 0.1). One patient in the metformin group dropped out due to nausea; no other side effects or adverse events were reported.[9]
In a systematic review that included 12 randomized controlled trials in women with PCOS, metformin produced a significant decrease in BMI when compared with placebo; however, many of the studies were not adequately powered, so the conclusion must be interpreted with caution and other clinical factors for individual patients considered. The review did not mention risk for hypoglycemia or if patients had impaired glucose tolerance.[8]
Some studies have looked at metformin in overweight and obese euglycemic patients.[10,11]
In a 6-month case control study, patients with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or higher and an average A1c of 5.6% received metformin with a dose based on their BMI. The average weight loss over 6 months was 5.8 ???Ò 7.0 kg, with a range of -35 kg to +13 kg. About 20% of the patients treated with metformin lost no weight. Gastrointestinal side effects were reported, which decreased with slower dose titration. No events of hypoglycemia were reported.[10]
In a systematic analysis, five studies with a primary outcome of weight loss showed that metformin treatment resulted in a range of weight loss between 2.9 and 9.0 kg. None of the studies were randomized or placebo-controlled, so interpretation is difficult. Gastrointestinal complaints were the most common adverse events, and hypoglycemia was not an issue.[11]

What are the best water resources today?	"An atmospheric water generator (AWG) is a device that extracts water from humid ambient air. Water vapor in the air is condensed by cooling the air below its dew point, exposing the air to desiccants, or pressurizing the air. Unlike a dehumidifier, an AWG is designed to render the water potable. AWGs are useful where pure drinking water is difficult or impossible to obtain, because there is almost always a small amount of water in the air that can be extracted. The two primary techniques in use are cooling and desiccants
Unique and advanced technology that extracts fresh water directly from the air.
The GENNY is small water from air generator that provides renewable source of clean and fresh drinking water for homes and offices. Requiring no infrastructure what so ever but electricity, it is literally a plug and drink solution, that can be installed in minutes anywhere, eliminating the daily dependency on bottled water.

Why are Sindhi people less religious?	"If you mean Sindhi Hindus in India, then yes, you may be right to a certain degree. Most of it has to do with the fact that during the time of partition, most had to leave their land and migrate to Independent India. The consequences of which were not only poverty but also the loss of a cultural identity. Many Sindhis in India today are not well versed with either their language, traditions or culture - not because they did not want to be but because they?õ????ve been culturally isolated enough to not remember. The generation that migrated was too busy building a future for themselves and getting out of their ?õ????refugee?õ???? status to be able to pass information on.
My generation and the one previous to mine has not been able to visit or even know about landmarks like the Zind Peer (now in Pakistan) to realise our cultural and religious identity and embrace it as ours.
These and many more factors have led to an ease in how we carry on with our Religious and cultural identity - which may be good or bad depending on how you look at it. However, in states and cities with a high number of Sindhi people, the community ensures that many festivals are celebrated jointly as a people and a lot of organisations are putting in their best to bring back and promote our culture.

Why do my fellow Hindus follow rituals blindly?	"my family included. pouring milk and ghee on shiva linga. Would you not get more punnya(good deeds?) if you rather give that milk or ghee to some kids living in slums or just donate it at an orphanage? people rush to temples at auspicious times as if on other days god won?õ????t listen to their prayers
Good question. I am quite glad that such a question came up. People need to know the facts so that their misconceptions should get cleared up. Please read completely to clear up the facts.
I have seen a lot of people questioning the same queries- Why Hindus waste milk on Shivlinga (idol denoting Lord Shiva) while hundreds of poor children remain hungry?
Yes, when we look in that angle, it certainly looks like a great amount of milk is wasted on a mere stone while living human kids aren?õ????t getting enough food. This question puts a criticism on the ritual of pouring milk and ghee (Indian version of clarified butter) on the idol. During the month of Sawan (Sraban in Odia & Bengali, monsoon in English), devotees pour water, milk and ghee on Shivlinga and worship the deity. On Shivratri, Hindu devotees all over India worship Lord Shiva and offer milk, ghee, water on the Shivlinga. We should also remember one thing. Pouring milk, ghee, water on Shivlinga is not limited to Sawan month or Shivratri. Many devotees offer milk and ghee on any other normal day too. Temples offer milk and ghee to deity on any ordinary day too.
In this answer, I would like to address overall facts and points. I would also cover the counter-arguments that could possibly come into someone?õ????s mind. I will provide reply to the possible counter-arguments too.
As per Hindu mythology, once Indra (King of Devas-deities) was to be tested. Sage Durvasa gave him a garland to check whether Indra respects the offering or not. Indra placed the garland on his elephant Airabat?õ????s trunk. When Airabat threw the garland to the ground, Durvasa became angry and cursed Indra that Devas will lose their power, energy and fortune.
After some days, Asuras defeated Devas and usurped the heaven from them. Lord Vishnu advised Devas to form diplomatic alliance with Asuras to carry out Samudra-Manthan (churning of ocean of milk) which will give them Amrit (nectar of immortality). Vasuki, the snake which hangs on Lord Shiva?õ????s neck, was the churning rope.
During the churning, a lot of objects were obtained. At last, the most dangerous poison known as Halahal (or Kalkut) emerged too. Some versions say it was the venom which was released from the mouth of Vasuki due to the pain he received during excessive churning. The poison started destroying the whole creation. Devas rushed to Lord Shiva for help. Lord Shiva, being the kindhearted God he is, swallowed the whole poison himself. However, Mata Parvati (wife of Lord Shiva) couldn?õ????t let her husband swallow the poison. She grabbed his neck to stop the venom go down his throat. The poison remained stagnant in Shiva?õ????s neck and it tuned his throat blue. That is why Shiva is also called Neelkantha (the one with blue neck).
Due to this most dangerous venom, Shiva becomes too hot sometimes. To relieve him from this heat, devotees pour water, milk and ghee (clarified butter) on him to keep him cool and calm.
Spiritual Reason 1:
I am pointing out some quotation from an article in the website SpeakingTree:-
Where ever Shivling is established and worshipped, it cleans the whole atmosphere. The bad energy in the atmosphere travels through the Shivling and gets cleaned. The energy is hot. When the energy becomes dirty, it becomes hotter. When these hot energies are continuously passing through the Shivling, it becomes hot, so we need to continuously keep pouring the water to keep it cool. When the Shivling is cool, it is more effective doing its work of purification. This gives way to bringing more light of consciousness to micro (individual) and macro (earth) levels.
Source:-
But I won?õ????t discuss on this point because I am not a spiritual teacher and people need to focus on more practical points. So let?õ????s proceed with more detailed facts.
Spiritual Reason 2: Why is milk offered to Shivlinga during monsoon?
As per Ayurveda,
?õ????Every person has three components- Vata (air), Kafa (cough) & Pitta (acid). These three components keep us healthy and functional when they have proper balance in our body?õ???ù
During monsoon season germs, bacteria, etc increase in number because it is their breeding season. That is why, even modern science reveals that leafy vegetables, fruits, milk, curd should not be consumed during monsoon.
Source:-
Since cows and cattle live on grass and vegetables and they can?õ????t sanitize or wash the vegetables like humans do, they eat vegetables and grass just like that. Sometimes they get infected with viral infection which could cause the milk become harmful too.
Lord Shiva is known for consuming poison to save mankind. In some spiritual cases, the harmful milk of monsoon is considered poison and hence, as a matter of spiritual belief, it is offered to Shivlinga.
So basically, it is suggested to avoid milk and curd during monsoon and we offer them on Shivlinga during monsoon.
Some might ask- ?õ????OK! Milk is harmful in monsoon season and we can throw them away. But what about devotee pouring milk on Shivlinga during non-monsoon days??õ???ù
Let?õ????s remember the basic science which we studied at class 6, ?õ????
India is a tropical country. We have high temperature during summer. Shivlingas are made up of mostly rocks and stones. The surface of rock will expand when heated while the inner side (which doesn?õ????t face heat & sunlight) will not expand. Thus this uneven expansion will cause cracks on rocks. It is a plain fact of thermal
Now match the basic science with the mythology of ?õ????
Some might ask- ?õ????Ok! If it is about keeping the Shivlinga cool, why can?õ????t we simply use water? Why do we need to waste milk??õ???ù
First of all, it is plain misconception that only milk or ghee is poured on Shivlinga. Devotees pour water on Shivlinga too. In fact, the amount of water poured on Shivlinga is much more than the amount of milk poured.
Secondly, the reason for pouring milk on the Shivlinga is exactly the same reason why some cosmetic companies claim that milk is an essential ingredient in their products. Milk is considered as a natural cleanser. The lipase in milk clears up oil-soluble impurities. The protease in milk cleans up the protein based impurities. If we observe minutely, most temples dedicated to Lord Shiva have a garbha-griha (central room for idols) where the Shivlinga is placed. Most of the times, the garbha-griha is like this:-
They don?õ????t have much windows or openings through which air could pass in abundant amount. Now, in most Hindu temples lamps, agarbatti (incense sticks) are burnt. Yagyas (oblation) are carried out by setting up a hawan-kunda (a rectangular fire altar where offerings are offered into fire). What I want to say is that the combustion of offerings produce smoke. This smoke contains carbon which gets deposited on idols if not properly washed or cleaned regularly. In yagyas and lamps ghee is offered which produces sticky smoke when burn. This smoke gets stuck to the idols, walls, etc of the garbha-griha. So milk was used to clean the Shivlinga.
In ancient times, people didn?õ????t have these ?õ????Lakme?õ???ù or ?õ????Loreal?õ???ù cosmetic products to cleanse their skin. Kings, noble men, women used to bathe in milk to get cleansed. That?õ????s why during abhishek (cleansing before ceremony) of kings, they were washed with milk. Queens used to have beauty bath with milk. Even it is known that world-famous Cleopatra, Elizabeth I of England, etc used to have
Hindu Gods are most dear to Hindu devotees. If Kings could bathe with milk for abhishek, why couldn?õ????t devotees perform Lord Shiva?õ????s abhishek with milk? That?õ????s why the custom started.
Let me clarify one point which most of the people forget to mention. The ritual of pouring milk/water on Shivlinga is millennia old custom. Hinduism (Sanatan Dharma) is the oldest religion in this world. Its customs and rituals are also millennia old. It didn?õ????t originate just one century ago or two century ago.
During the dawn of Hinduism, the population wasn?õ????t as big as India?õ????s current population. That time, population was very less and the food supply was abundant. To prove my point, I am using an excerpt:-
As per British economist, Angus Maddison India's share of the world income went from 27% in 1700 AD (compared to Europe's share of 23%) to 3% in 1950.
Source:-
In 1700 AD, India?õ????s share was 27% in world economy even after numerous invaders invaded and looted India. This makes sense that India was more prosperous during the ancient times when Hinduism was seeing its dawn. That means there was quite less number of poor, foodless people too. One reason of less poor people was population factor due to which less competition was there. Also as suggested by some historians, ancient Indians were generous towards poor too. A poor family could easily get its easy meal from the other families in the village because the community binding was strong and people used to collectively help someone in need, thanks to the religious Hindu doctrines which say that you would go to heaven if you help the poor. So precisely, even after pouring milk on idols, no poor was sleeping empty-stomach at night during the ancient times.
Yes, in some temples milk does get wasted because of the architectural design. One such design is this:-
In the above image, the milk is getting poured on the floor. There is no Shakti (the oval base on which Shivlinga is placed). Hence there is no mean to collect the milk after pouring it on the Shivlinga. It flows down to the floor and gets wasted.
But not all temples have design like this. Many temples have provision to collect the milk as shown in the below image.
The milk is poured on Shivlinga which then flows down and reaches the Shakti. The Shakti has a channel which causes the milk to flow towards the front side. Below the channel, a container is placed to collect the milk. The milk isn?õ????t wasted because the milk is considered holy. It is considered as Prasadam (leftover of offerings to God). Hindu devotees consume this milk.
There is another image shown below. The image shows how the offered milk is taken by devotees for consumption. So no wastage of milk in these two cases.
There are many more temples which don?õ????t waste milk but collect them for consumption. Even many temples distribute the milk to poor children too.
Hindu temples do distribute the milk to the poor. The milk used for abhishek of the idol is collected in containers placed under the Shakti base. Some portion of the milk is distributed to the devotees as Prasadam (offering of God) and rest is distributed to beggars, poor people & hungry kids in the temple complex. This practice has been prevalent in many temples.
One of such temple is Mahadev temple in Saraspura in Gujarat where milk is distributed among poor kids.
I could provide the news link, but the news link is in Gujarati language which might violate Quora?õ????s language policy.
Another such temple is Saketri temple in Chandigarh where milk is collected from the devotees and is distributed among poor kids.
There are many temples where the temple administrations feed poor people. However, this charity is never covered up by our national media. I will cover up some informations regarding this issue:-
This is the image of Noida Ayyappa temple feeding poor children. They provide food to the hungry stomach of numerous kids who can?õ????t even have a decent meal.
This is an image from Varanasi. The temple administration is providing food to poor people during night. However, such news remain unheard, thanks to our national media.
This is another image from Tirupati temple where temple committee is providing free food to all the devotees and poor people as well.
Another image of some not-so-famous ashram (hermitage or monastic community) where food is distributed to the poor and the homeless.
This is another image where Jalakanteswara temple launched ?õ????Nithya Annadanam scheme?õ???? which aims at providing free food on daily basis. Source:-
Free food are also provided to people at temples of Dharmasthala, Shringeri, Horanadu, etc in Karnataka. Source:-
The Jagannath temple ar Puri also distributes free food and Mahaprasad to the poor people. Here is the
So you see, Hindu temples all over India provide food to the poor people. Many Hindu temple committees run schools to spread education. Such a temple committee is Dakshineswar Ramkrishna Sangha, Adyapeeth, West Bengal which runs schools and orphanages for boys and girls. I know about this personally because my mother donates some small amount of money to them each month for their welfare scheme.
Hindus do know how to help the poor and the homeless.
It?õ????s really appreciable if we are concerned about the wastage of milk which is poured on Shivlinga. Food should not be wasted. But I fail to understand why such questions arise regarding a Hindu tradition when we totally ignore other facts?
We, the so-called elite, educated and well-to-do middle class and upper class people, waste food in restaurants when we fill our platter with food more than we can eat. On the other hand, there are thousands of hungry kids who can?õ????t even have a bite on a chapati (Indian food item made of flour).
We, the so-called youth and students, waste food in hostels and canteens just because it doesn?õ????t suit our taste-buds.
We, the so-called elite class, consider consumption of whisky and beer a luxurious and prestigious status while grains are wasted to prepare these delicacies when thousands of poor people can?õ????t even have enough food per day and black-market is destroying the national economy.
From when did our alcoholic luxury become more important than the aching hunger of a poor child?

We, the so-called movie goers, watch same movie multiple times in the movie theaters and pay money for that. However, many of us can?õ????t donate a single rupee to the needy. Some may argue that when we watch movies in a theater, a lot of people associated with the film production company are benefited- like poor spot-boys, cameraman, make-up man, etc. I want to clear a misconception. Poor people like spot-boys, cameraman, make-up man, etc get money (like salary) only one time. No matter how many times we watch the movie, they don?õ????t get extra share from the money. If we see the same movie multiple times, then only theater owners, producers, directors and in some cases superstar actors get benefit (if they hold a percentage of share on the profit).
Yes, it may seem like Hindu temples waste milk on Shivratri, but throughout the year, a lot more food is wasted which is hundred times bigger than the amount of milk poured on Shivlinga. We should remember one thing. Milk is poured on Shivlinga on Shivratri and during the month of monsoon. Food is wasted in canteens, restaurants throughout the year. Grains are wasted in storehouses due to black-marketing all throughout the year.
May be that?õ????s why, India ranks seventh in overall food wastage in the world. Let me provide an excerpt from an article:-
A recent study conducted by Indian Institute of Management, Kolkata, revealed that only 10 per cent of foods get cold storage facility in India, this factor, accompanied by inappropriate supply chain management, has resulted in India becoming a significant contributor towards food wastage both at pre and post harvest waste in cereals, pulses, fruits and vegetables. India ranks 63 among 88 countries in Global Hunger Index with 20 crore Indians sleeping hungry on any given night, but in spite of this, nearly 21 million tonnes of wheat are wasted in India each year instead of reaching the needy.

I am proud of my religion which always re-modifies itself for the betterment of its followers. While on the other hand, we may criticize Hindu rituals but forget to question ourselves about the wastage of food which we do even after being rational and educated.
Last but not the least, I could have stated about wastage of milk in other religion too. But that would not have been good. People might say that ?õ????two wrongs don?õ????t make a thing right?õ???ù. So I won?õ????t talk about that in detail. In case anybody is curious to know, please make a search on Google website using these following keywords- ?õ????washing floor with milk shrine?õ???ù.

Will a narcissist who dates several different women at a time ever change to only one?	"There are three main reasons why Narcissists date more than one person at a time, and only one of these reasons leads to an intimate and committed relationship.
Many Narcissists who are dating multiple people for ?õ????Reason 1?õ???ù do marry and settle down monogamously with one person, but these are the ones who actually have that as one of their life goals. They want an intimate partner, even though they lack many of the skills that make for a successful one-on-one relationship. These are the Narcissists who date multiple people in an attempt to find that perfect, special person who will meet all their needs. They may be unrealistic about what they expect from their partner, but they are committed to finding a life partner.

Is it fair for a parent to make a 17 and 13 year old pay for basic toiletries?	"Fair? Fair is a hard concept, because it is so frequently dependent on the individual perspective.
For instance, a 16-year old who is expected to contribute some of his income towards the family upkeep may feel that his parents should let him keep his own money and instead downsize the family into a 1-bedroom ?õ???? he?õ????s willing to share a room with his parents in order to leave them and their bad financial choices behind, in return for getting a jump-start on his own financial situation so that he never ends up in that position. His parents may feel differently about having to share a room with their son, especially if they are providing other aspects of room and board. They may think it?õ????s perfectly fair for them to receive some of his income in return for making the insurance payments on the car that enables that 16-year old to keep his job.
This is, of course, a bit of a dramatic example, but it?õ????s meant to illustrate that family finances are often more complex than they seem on the surface.
The OP speaks of being forced to upgrade their phones rather than switching providers in order to keep the family plan cheaper, but you know, a phone is not a necessity of life for a teenager, much as it might seem to be so. There is no inalienable right of teenager-hood that forces the parent to provide a phone for the child. If the parent had a good reason for not wanting to switch providers (and there are many such), then I suspect that it is quite a bit cheaper overall for the teens as it worked out than it would have been if the parents had set up a separate plan for the teen phones with that other provider and then told them that they were permanently responsible for the entire monthly costs of that plan ?õ???? in other words, ?õ????you want a phone, you pay for the phone?õ???ù.
Rather than address the question of what is fair, I suggest that it is more straightforward to consider the question of what is
I personally believe that the reasonable person standard, when applied here, would say that it is reasonable for a parent to expect teenaged children to contribute to the family upkeep ?õ???? both chores and finances ?õ???? to any extent that is appropriately aligned with their income, and which aligns appropriately with the relative contribution of the parents based on their income. Let?õ????s translate a little:
For some more back and forth on what are reasonable expectations for teen contributions from a paycheck, I refer you to
Before finishing, I?õ????d like to offer my perspective on why it is not only potentially reasonable, but also
My husband and I are fortunate to make a very comfortable living. Part of the reason for this is that we delayed having children; had we started 10 years earlier, our standard of living while raising our children would have been much, much lower than it actually was. The consequence of this is that our children are accustomed to a lifestyle that they are very unlikely to be able to support on their own income immediately after they move out and become responsible for their own upkeep.
In my opinion, we would be doing a poor job as parents if we did not prepare them to be able to maintain a standard of living that is in line with their income. It is therefore imperative that we educate them about the difference between need and want, about delaying gratification when necessary, and how to make decisions about value when shopping.
There is simply no better method to teach financial responsibility than to give children actual practice by handing them control over making many of the banal, every day purchasing decisions that they will have to make later. It leads to conversations like the following one that I had with my daughter:
?õ????Will you please pay the extra so I can buy these nicer binders for school??õ???ù
?õ????No, you have your own budget. If you think they?õ????re worth it, then you can pay for them.?õ???ù
?õ????But I don?õ????t want to.?õ???ù
?õ????So let me get this straight ?õ???? you think they?õ????re better enough in quality that you?õ????re willing to spend
?õ????Dang, I hate it when you have a good argument?õ???ù.
The first year, she stuck with the cheap ones. The second year, she asked again if we would buy them for her, but when we said no, she bought them for herself. In order to help pay the difference, she re-used some supplies from the year before that she normally would buy new every year, and we didn?õ????t even have to suggest it.

Why do people choose to not believe in God even though science has proven his existence?	"It is not really a conscious choice to disbelieve in a religion. It is rather that because the arguments put forward by a religion are not convincing so that people lose their faith.
Let's take Gerald Schroeder's main point: He argues that, according to the current state of scientific knowledge, the universe has a beginning and that it was created from nothing. Creating something from nothing would only be possible if you have the laws of nature. This means, the laws of nature must have predated the universe, which Schroeder concludes is the definition of God.
Let's assume the statement is true that the laws of nature have predated the universe. It doesn't really convince me that they are therefore the God of Abraham. If at all, I could accept the idea of a ""god"" who has set the stage for the universe to be created, but done nothing since 13.77B years.
But then, why should we conclude this ""god"":

What can I do to learn and be an amateur astronomer in the Bay area?	"That depends on where you live ?õ???? it?õ????s a big area!

So, that might not be a bad place to start.

[And, while I?õ????m sure you can learn a lot hanging out with people, at some point, you?õ????ll probably want to read a book or two and start frequenting some on-line forums, like CloudyNights.]

If the world turned into the minecraft world and you were with 7 billion people what would be the first step for you to survive?	"Assuming that Minecraft logistics (gravity defying blocks, survival, no cheats, normal) apply, the logical first choice would be to try to get iron armor as fast as possible, and a compatible, reliable food source. Also, I?õ????m also assuming that you keep your skills, and if you?õ????re good at Minecraft In real life, (I?õ????m not including respawning, as that completely renders this question kind of useless).
Because I?õ????m decent at PVP, and all of my friends are more than decent at PVP, I would probably then just go to my friends, seeing as they are more informed at survival. I usually play on servers, instead of single player, so I have only a very limited knowledge on important things like redstone and potions.
Other then that, I would try to establish a base, or maybe stay at my friends?õ???? bases. But you would have guard it really well, given that now everybody can break almost anything with their bare hands. I would probably build an underground base, seeing as it?õ????s harder to find then one on the surface.
So, I would probably just try to group up with my friends, and try to survive using my own knowledge of Minecraft.
Hope this helps! :)

How can I prepare myself to clear the interview for Amazon India as a WDE (Web Development Engineer)?	"At Amazon, when we say WDEs, we look for
Whereas WDE-1s are expected to have all the basics and be able to solve problems and translate them to code correctly, WDE-2s will be expected to also be able to independently
Here are some of the basic skill sets expected -
Generally, WDEs do not focus on problem solving much. This can cause quite a few of them to get eliminated. In the interviews, one needs to demonstrate ability to solve basic problems (such as string manipulations) efficiently and translate those solutions to code. Coding in javascript and CSS will be part of the interviews. You?õ????ll also need to articulate answers to questions around basic behavior on the web around protocols, security or performance. For WDE-2s, design questions and open ended questions may be asked to understand their ability to work on the full-stack. Being able to develop for the mobile may be important. One may be asked questions specific to development for the mobile web.
In addition to these, you will be tested for basic cultural fit. You may want to read about this in my answer to

Can too much porn and masturbation cause erectile dysfunction?	"Its not really erectile dysfunction, this kind of things are only in your head, you're used to satisfy yourself in one way and wasnt able to adjust to a new sexual setting.
I recommend you stop masturbating to porn, try to imagine real girls and try to ejaculate with less stimuli, with that i mean you should try to be more aroused instead of just jacking off like a robot, you can have a higher quality masturbation time.

How is 666 related to Lucifer?	"Says the Apocalypse that the beast could say greatness and blasphemies by 42 months, adding that their number was 666. We can take each month as being 30 years, obtaining, a period of 1260 years, precisely the period between 610 and 1870 A.D., when the Papacy was consolidated, after his birth, with the emperor Phocas, in 607, and the decree of papal infallibility with Pius IX, in 1870, which noted the decadence and absence of authority of the Vatican, in face of evolution scientific, philosophical and religious of Humanity.
The number 666. We must to search to roman numerals, explaining that is the Supreme Pontiff of the roman church who uses the titles of VICARIVS GENERALIS DEI IN TERRIS, VICARIVS FILII DEI and DVX CLERI meaning Vicar General of God on Earth, Vicar of the Son of God and Prince of the Clergy. It will suffice for the scholar a little game of patience, adding the roman numerals found in each papal title to find the same equation of 666, in each one of them.

If you get a transfusion of a component that your body doesn't produce in its own blood, the body panics and attacks the blood like an invader - so instead of carrying oxygen and fighting infections and all of those other things the transfusion is supposed to do, you are further compromised by your body using up even more resources destroying the blood that was meant to help.

What can be tips for a fat girl for wearing saree?	"Thank you for the A2A.
I always tell people that they should wear something they feel confident in. But the sari is one attire that needs a certain grace to be able to carry it well. I am not so skinny myself and hence I speak from my personal experience of having experimented with saris for over 20 years now ;)
No enormous paisleys.
No enormous roses. No over sized geometric patterns. No horizontal stripes! Hell No!
And definitely no checkered patterns either. I would suggest saris with small floral patterns, small geometric patterns or small yet elegant zari works. This goes a long way, trust me!
Nope. No. Nada. Or just plain No! Trust me. Been there, done that. The floating style of wearing the pallu is the easiest way to do it, I agree. But if you are wearing an opaque sari and if you're not exactly svelte, you'd probably end up looking like a burrito!
Which is what I looked like when I tried this style. It's a different story if the sari is partially transparent. The wearer's body-shape is subtly visible and the burrito image goes out the window ;)
There is absolutely no hint of the body shape from the front and this makes the wearer appear to look bigger than she actually is. There is only a slight view of the midriff from the side and from the backside, and this is also sometimes completely covered up. And if you have a rear you are not too proud of, you'd not want unwanted attention to those areas either. The Gujarati style looks stunning on a normal sized woman who has a pretty waist to show off. And this is the best way to show off those elaborate zari works.
But then you've gotta decide if you would flaunt your zardosi or your best overall look.
I have this flashy bottle green sari with extra heavy gold zari work on it and the blouse came attached with the sari...so obviously it had the same heavy gaudy work on it. It was probably one of the most stupid decisions I have ever taken, but I decided to wear the sari and blouse as a set, thinking that if they have attached the blouse with it, then it was meant to be worn together. Oh what a disaster I looked like that day! I looked better suited to go as a mascot for the Australian Cricket Team rather than for a wedding! *facepalm* I did wear the same sari and the same blouse on several occasions after that day...but I wore a plain silk blouse with it. And it looked fabulous!
It also works the other way around.
And always remember to wear your footwear
Dark colors seem to confuse the beholders about the size of the person wearing the sari. I wear a lot of dark hues of green, blue, maroon and plenty of black! ;)
As opposed to this...
This can however be overlooked if the sari has a border only on one edge...the bottom edge. This style of sari is usually seen in the Kanchipuram silk saris of Tamil Nadu. 'Single-Side Border', they call it.
I prefer to wear saris that are flowy and easy to manage. I do wear a lot of heavy Kanchipuram saris as well but they need to be controlled and this needs a bit of wearing experience. I prefer wearing light silks and thick chiffon for regular wear.
I'm from Kerala and I'm required to wear our traditional saree at times, mostly at festive occasions. It's basically a hand-woven cotton saree with a border made of pure gold threads. This is the only cotton saree I wear and I like wearing as well. It's very light-weight and extremely comfortable to wear.
Phew! I hope that sums up most of the stuff I follow. I will edit this answer if I remember anything else :) Hope this helps.
Happy Dolling Up! :) :) :)
P.S.: A little disclaimer. All the above women look gorgeous and I love all of them, especially when they are in a saree. I may appear to be heavily biased towards Vidya Balan, what with the picture overload...but I can't help it. She is my ultimate fashion idol :D And I can't get anyone else in my mind when I think of a saree. Most of what I have written are rules I have set for myself based on my body type and based on what looks good on me. It may be different for you. Keep experimenting with various styles until you arrive at what you like. Cheers!

What should be server specification for Django and Angular 2 application?	"It depends on what your application is doing and (mostly), how many people are using it at one time. Angular 2 is just Javascript when it?õ????s deployed on your production server - it runs on the client and has no impact on server performance*. Like with any half-way decently designed JS application, the only server loads you should generate ?õ????from JavaScript?õ???ù - meaning from client-side JavaScript - are the processing involved in the AJAX calls - which are handled by your Django REST APIs.
*Caveat - if you?õ????re downloading a huge JavaScript file, that will affect performance of the initial page load. However, there?õ????s an easy way to avoid this. Don?õ????t write huge JavaScript files. As a general rule in Angular 2, place each component, directive, and service in its own file. The generated JavaScript will be build the same way. Angular can also lazy load modules, with some caveats on the design pattern, as discussed here:

What is your opinion regarding the recent Maharashtra doctor strike in March 2017?	"Here I attempt to bust some myths about resident doctors?õ???? strikes and hope to arm the reader with some relevant knowledge. And then the reader is free to form an opinion as to how valid strikes are as a measure. This is taken from a blog post of mine titled ?õ????
This is surely the most ridiculous of corollaries. We see some sensationalist reporters framing headlines like ?õ????Doctors strike in UP: 6 patients die?õ????. I would invite the reporter to go see the records of hospital deaths on any non-strike day, and on most occasions they?õ????ll find similar death statistics. Perhaps they even know that; what matters to them is sensational click-worthy headlines. In fact doctors find it very hard to understand the completely uncalled-for negative reaction of the media to their valid causes.
There are dozens of reasons that can cause the death of a hospitalized patient, but ?õ????doctors on strike?õ???? doesn?õ????t figure anywhere in the list. Whenever there is a fire in a hospital, or a natural calamity, most doctors and healthcare workers rush for patients?õ???? safety first and foremost without caring about their own: that is just their nature. And even when a section of a hospital?õ????s workers goes on strike, there are always other trained, professional personnel present to take care of critical patients. No one is allowed to die due to negligence.
Imagine your next door neighbor playing ear-splitting, deafening, utterly crappy music day in and day out, and you are not even allowed to go to him and tell him to shut it. The only choice you are left with is to suffer. That?õ????s what happens with doctors in India. Remember, for all resident doctors, the government is but a next door neighbor! (In fact if I were the above-mentioned reporter, my sensationalist headline would have read ?õ????Doctors?õ???? Strike: Apathetic Govt Kills 6 Patients?õ????.)
Almost every day doctors have to encounter the government in all its various (frequently vicious) avatars: corruption, apathy, helplessness to assist genuine patients, archaic rules and laws, nonsensical regulations, MLAs and local politicians making unethical demands, etc. There are endless issues in the healthcare system and doctors bear the brunt bravely and silently most of the time. But every once in a while the govt makes it absolutely impossible for them to work in the status quo, with some explosion becoming unavoidably necessary to shake lethargic authorities. A strike is only a last resort, and if people are seeing strikes more frequently these days, then they better ruminate on how hopeless the administration has become that a last resort mechanism has to be employed more often.
It is a common property of social systems: if unjust rules and laws are not taken back by an authority, then non-cooperation remains the most peaceful way to protest. There is nothing wrong with doctors going on strike for the right reasons, more so because ultimately the benefits trickle down to the only all-important entity of any health system: the patient; satisfied doctors and better facilities always result in better patient services.
There are two issues here. Firstly, why should demanding a better pay be considered wrong? And secondly, more medico strikes happen for better security, infrastructure, and quality of life than for better pay.
Everyone wants a good salary, and society and media should now seriously do away with this age-old practice of expecting some kind of ?õ????ideal?õ???? attitude from doctors. In India even teachers strike for better pay by boycotting board exams. Since the public is so obsessed with the argument that doctors deal with people?õ????s lives so they shouldn?õ????t go on strikes, it?õ????s strange why they don?õ????t employ it when doctors demand better pay: how can they stand someone who deals with their very lives being paid so miserably? Of course life is priceless, and to be honest any pay that a doctor gets is perhaps always going to be ?õ????inadequate?õ???? by such parameters. Still, everyone has a right to a decent life, be it doctors, teachers or taxi drivers. So when govt apathy forces them to go on strike, we should at least display some empathy.
Secondly, as has been time and again pointed out by doctors themselves and by some sensible journalists (yes they do exist!), the living conditions of most resident doctors in India are totally outrageous. Cramped rooms, filthy bathrooms, pests everywhere, inadequate sleep, sudden patient and politician violence ?õ???? you name it. The government is aware of all that but does almost nothing concrete. And then when things go out of hand, a strike becomes inevitable. Resident doctors won?õ????t go on a strike unless forced to: toiling hard to see a smile on a patient?õ????s face is much more satisfying than dealing with idiotic, corrupt, selfish authorities.

Why do we use threads in Java programming?	"Threads are used to concurrently **run** something. For example: to collect air fares from 5 different airlines for a given route and show them to user, we can fetch the fares in parallel.
Let me give another example :
You are working on a UI using JAVA FX. FX is nothing but a library for creating desktop applications. In FX , there is one thread(FX Thread) which paints/renders/draws the UI on your laptop screen. Can you use the same thread to say fetch data from database ? If you use the same thread , what would happen . It would make it busy and stop painting UI on screen. The end result is a stuck application that hangs. In such cases you can use a separate worker thread.
Java itself uses threads abundantly inside JVM for performing parallel activities besides running our application(main thread) , like cleaning up heap space/garbage collection(GC thread). Good thing is Java provides threads to developers to do similar stuff for our application as well.

How do Liberals get away with the McCarthyism of calling anyone who disagrees with them a racist or white supremacist?	"Racist and white supremist are are one category that everyone should condemn. I am offering that as a given. If you disagree with that, then we really have no common set of values to base a discussion on.
However, many people who would swear that they are not racists have racist beliefs and behaviors. Failure to consider that the life of a person of color is different than the life of a white person is a form of racism. So if your response to Black Lives Matter is All Lives Matter, then you are racist. Because something is easy, possible, or safe for you doesn't mean it is that way for a minority. If you think voter ID is a necessary policy, when voter fraud is not a problem, and it targets people of color, then you are a racist. Claiming that you are color blind does not mean you are not racist.
Many conservatives are not racist even under that criteria. And few are really white supremist.
But among trump supporters, even if you are not a racist, you support a man who, among his bigly number of character flaws, is a racist. You support a man who has empowered white supremists. And that is the concern.
We don't call everyone we disagree with racists and white supremist, unless what they say and support indicates racism. There are a myriad of excellent reasons to disagree with trump supporters. Racism is but one.
Edit: The idea of understanding what it means to be a person of color in America is subtle. I don't know what it is like to Black, or Mexican, or Muslim. I have never walked a mile in their shoes.
But even so I know it is different. I know I have advantages due to my heritage, skin color, and class.
It is the failure to acknowledge the difference that I am specifically calling out here. And it might not be the racism of the south in the early 1960s, but it is racism.

What should I do if I filed a trademark for my company's name and received a cease and desist letter for trademark infringement?		
Is God's love conditional or unconditional?	"God?õ????s love, as described in the Bible, is clearly unconditional in that His love is expressed toward the objects of His love (that is, His people) despite their disposition toward Him. In other words, God loves because it His nature to love (1 John 4:8), and that love moves Him toward benevolent action. The unconditional nature of God?õ????s love is most clearly seen in the gospel. The gospel message is basically a story of divine rescue. As God considers the plight of His rebellious people, He determines to save them from their sin, and this determination is based on His love (Ephesians 1:4-5). Listen to the Apostle Paul?õ????s words from his letter to the Romans:
?õ????You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us?õ???ù (Romans 5:6-8).
Reading through the book of Romans, we learn that we are alienated from God due to our sin. We are at enmity with God, and His wrath is being revealed against the ungodly for their unrighteousness (Romans 1:18-20). We reject God, and God gives us over to our sin. We also learn that we have all sinned and fallen short of God?õ????s glory (Romans 3:23) and that none of us seek God, none of us do what is right before His eyes (Romans 3:10-18).
Despite this hostility and enmity we have toward God (for which God would be perfectly just to utterly destroy us), God reveals His love toward us in the giving of His Son, Jesus Christ, as the propitiation (that is, the appeasement of God?õ????s righteous wrath) for our sins. God did not wait for us to better ourselves as a condition of atoning for our sin. Rather, God condescended to become a man and live among His people (John 1:14). God experienced our humanity?õ????everything it means to be a human being?õ????and then offered Himself willingly as a substitutionary atonement for our sin.
This divine rescue resulted in a gracious act of self-sacrifice. As Jesus says in John?õ????s gospel, ?õ????Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends?õ???ù (John 15:13). That is precisely what God, in Christ, has done. The unconditional nature of God?õ????s love is made clear in two more passages from Scripture:
?õ????But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions?õ????it is by grace you have been saved?õ???ù (Ephesians 2:4-5).
""This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins"" (1 John 4:9-10).
It is important to note that God?õ????s love is a love that initiates; it is never a response. That is precisely what makes it unconditional. If God?õ????s love were conditional, then we would have to do something to earn or merit it. We would have to somehow appease His wrath and cleanse ourselves of our sin before God would be able to love us. But that is not the biblical message. The biblical message?õ????the gospel?õ????is that God, motivated by love, moved unconditionally to save His people from their sin.

Should I go for CAT or GMAT after completing my b.com without having any work experience? How can I get scolarship or loan for my higher studies?	"GMAT ideally requires 3?õ????5 years of experience. IIMs, FMS and other institutes that accept CAT relatively take many more freshers into MBA as compared to forigen universities that accept GMAT.
First you should go through sites like pagalguy etc and see the discussion blogs about MBA as fresher vs experienced candidate. Doing MBA as fresher or experienced candidate both have their own pros and cons first you should analyse it.
Second then if you decide doing after gaining experience then only move on to the next type of blogs for information on GMAT vs CAT what to do ?
Getting a loan is not a big issue. Once you have decided what you are doing focus on scoring great. A formal inquiry with any of the banks will give you good knowledge about how much loan you will be given with what so ever specifications. Also I suggest you to join some good groups on facebook for GMAT preparation and application process. For CAT there are groups as well as enough experts around us I believe. Take a holistic view and then decide. Best wishes !! :)

Why is this Earth So awesome?	"Earth is one awesome place to be lads! One awesome place to be!
It?õ????s actually 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds. This is the amount of time it takes for the Earth to completely rotate around its axis; astronomers call this a sidereal day. Now wait a second, that means a day is 4 minutes shorter than we think it is. The biggest mindfuck is that time should add up, day by day, and within a few months, day should be night, and night shouof be day.
As you?õ????re probably aware, Earth has 1 moon (The Moon). But did you know there are 2 additional asteroids locked into a co-orbital orbits with Earth? They?õ????re called 3753 Cruithne and 2002 AA29. We won?õ????t go into too much detail about the Moon, I?õ????m sure you?õ????ve heard all about it.
This deceleration is happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per hundred years, although the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly uniform. This has the effect of lengthening our days, but it happens so slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the length of a day will have increased to 25 hours.
Scientists now believe that we were once not alone in our orbit around the Sun ?õ???? we had a ?õ????twin?õ???ù planet we call Theia, which was the size of Mars and was 60 degrees either in front or behind our Big Blue Ball. One afternoon about 4.533 billion years ago, Theia crashed into the Earth; most of the planet was absorbed, but a large chunk blew off and combined with materials from our planet to create the Moon. Why do we think this? It's because our Moon is unusually large for a planet of our size and has metallic isotopes similar to those on Earth.
True, it's one of the most famous mountains in the world, and at 29,035 ft. above sea level it's pretty darn tall. However, considering we now know that the Earth is not round (see #1), anyone or anything along the equator is slightly closer to the stars. This means that although Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador is just 20,564 ft. above sea level, because it is on this ?õ????bump?õ???ù it is technically further away from the Earth's center (i.e. ?õ????higher?õ???ù) than Everest by 1.5 miles!

How do I handle someone who is madly in love with me and cuts herself when I don't talk to her?	"I just saw your question flashed on Quora. I want to write an answer for you, I may be wrong but this situation which you explained on details I got something similar story happened with my brother's friend.
He was an engineering student and that girl was his junior, she started loving this guy so much madly but he did not love her. He was very talented and topper in school and a very biggest fan of Rahul Dravid(he was recognized as Dravid in our colony because of his calm and pleasant nature). He was a civil servant aspirant too.
So finally love came into his life without his acceptance, she cut her veins and blackmailed him whether he is going to love him or not, if not she will commit suicide.
And he was even blackmailed over phone by goons and public servants as her father was local MLA in that place where he was doing his engineering.
So finally with no choice left he has to accept her love.
Fast forward engineering 4 years later.
This guy was left with 8 backlogs and she completed her engineering and left to US just to spend her father money, came back and got married to another MLAs son settled in US and forgot about him.
Now about this guy, he was not allowed to sit in campus placement so lost job, cleared all his backlogs in next 6 months and struggled to concentrate on his goal which was impossible because he lost his motivation and finally his mother blackmailed him to get married to some other girl and he did it.
After 2 years of marriage he has 2 kids and he is still attending group 4 exams but didn't see any light and sometimes he works in mechanic shop and sometimes he will not have any work.
To be very honest when I was kid I was really impressed by his attitude and later when I learned about his story I felt very sad, that attitude which he used to carry was similar to Rahul Dravid I personally believe someone with that attitude can achieve anything they want but his life failed at some phase or may be he accepted it I really dont know.
One lesson which I learned after this incident is you have got everything in your hand and your will power should be stronger than all your emotions , relationship is very painful stuff no one can control that emotion but keep it personal, if you want to go for anything do it but do no let go off your ambition of being great period.

Where do I incorporate my s-corp? Legalzoom? Rocketlawyer? Can I do it in person and cheaper?	"When incorporating, small mistakes - especially with following through with requirements after filing with the state - often result in big consequences. Important transactions such as incorporating often involve secondary requirements that extend beyond the boilerplate legal documents you will find on sites like LegalZoom. Furthermore, regulations regarding formation are always subject to change which means that you could miss some vital updates that result in a faulty or incomplete application.
Without criticizing LegalZoom or any similar service, I would advise you to take a look at the disclaimers on the DIY sites since there are some pretty significant caveat emptors that will quickly reveal their limitations. Also, you run the risk when using DIY legal forms because they are largely standardized and may leave out important details specific to your company.
Startups that rely on cheaper options such as LegalZoom to incorporate can actually end up financially weaker as a result. Hiring an attorney to incorporate your startup over using LegalZoom can provide the following benefits:
Finding a startup lawyer in your area will be familiar with the laws of your state and well-versed in the incorporation process. If you need a hand finding a lawyer, take a look at our website

"If a resistor is in a series with a capacitor, why does the capacitor not charge to the voltage value based on the voltage drop of the resistor?"	"As long as there is a voltage difference between the capacitor and the voltage source, there will be a voltage difference accross the resistor, and this means that there will be current flowing through it, into the capacitor.
The only way in which that current will be zero is if the voltage accross the resistor is zero, which means that the capacitor?õ????s voltage must equal that of the voltage supply.

No on can get along with everyone, but most of us get along with most people. When I have found myself in a difficult situation because of friction with another person, I evaluate it. For instance, if I am not getting along with a co-worker, I consider the big picture. If I am getting along with everyone else (or almost everyone else) and my managers have a positive opinion about me, I do not worry about it. But if I found myself in a situation where a lot of people did not like me, I would have to take a look at myself. What I am doing that is causing so much friction.
It is all relative.

Why did god allow slavery?	"Here is an Answer entirely provided at this website:
Answer: There is a tendency to look at slavery as something of the past. But it is estimated that there are today over 27 million people in the world who are subject to slavery: forced labor, sex trade, inheritable property, etc. As those who have been redeemed from the slavery of sin, followers of Jesus Christ should be the foremost champions of ending human slavery in the world today. The question arises, though, why does the Bible not speak out strongly against slavery? Why does the Bible, in fact, seem to support the practice of human slavery?
The Bible does not specifically condemn the practice of slavery. It gives instructions on how slaves should be treated (Deuteronomy 15:12-15; Ephesians 6:9; Colossians 4:1), but does not outlaw slavery altogether. Many see this as the Bible condoning all forms of slavery. What many fail to understand is that slavery in biblical times was very different from the slavery that was practiced in the past few centuries in many parts of the world. The slavery in the Bible was not based exclusively on race. People were not enslaved because of their nationality or the color of their skin. In Bible times, slavery was based more on economics; it was a matter of social status. People sold themselves as slaves when they could not pay their debts or provide for their families. In New Testament times, sometimes doctors, lawyers, and even politicians were slaves of someone else. Some people actually chose to be slaves so as to have all their needs provided for by their masters.
The slavery of the past few centuries was often based exclusively on skin color. In the United States, many black people were considered slaves because of their nationality; many slave owners truly believed black people to be inferior human beings. The Bible condemns race-based slavery in that it teaches that all men are created by God and made in His image (Genesis 1:27). At the same time, the Old Testament did allow for economic-based slavery and regulated it. The key issue is that the slavery the Bible allowed for in no way resembled the racial slavery that plagued our world in the past few centuries.
In addition, both the Old and New Testaments condemn the practice of ?õ????man-stealing,?õ???ù which is what happened in Africa in the 19th century. Africans were rounded up by slave-hunters, who sold them to slave-traders, who brought them to the New World to work on plantations and farms. This practice is abhorrent to God. In fact, the penalty for such a crime in the Mosaic Law was death: ?õ????Anyone who kidnaps another and either sells him or still has him when he is caught must be put to death?õ???ù (Exodus 21:16). Similarly, in the New Testament, slave-traders are listed among those who are ?õ????ungodly and sinful?õ???ù and are in the same category as those who kill their fathers or mothers, murderers, adulterers and perverts, and liars and perjurers (1 Timothy 1:8?õ????10).
Another crucial point is that the purpose of the Bible is to point the way to salvation, not to reform society. The Bible often approaches issues from the inside out. If a person experiences the love, mercy, and grace of God by receiving His salvation, God will reform his soul, changing the way he thinks and acts. A person who has experienced God?õ????s gift of salvation and freedom from the slavery of sin, as God reforms his soul, will realize that enslaving another human being is wrong. He will see, with Paul, that a slave can be ?õ????a brother in the Lord?õ???ù (Philemon 1:16). A person who has truly experienced God?õ????s grace will in turn be gracious towards others. That would be the Bible?õ????s prescription for ending slavery.

"When playing Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door, has the number 666 appeared from time to time?"	"Says the Apocalypse that the beast could say greatness and blasphemies by 42 months, adding that their number was 666. We can take each month as being 30 years, obtaining, a period of 1260 years, precisely the period between 610 and 1870 A.D., when the Papacy was consolidated, after his birth, with the emperor Phocas, in 607, and the decree of papal infallibility with Pius IX, in 1870, which noted the decadence and absence of authority of the Vatican, in face of evolution scientific, philosophical and religious of Humanity.
The number 666. We must to search to roman numerals, explaining that is the Supreme Pontiff of the roman church who uses the titles of VICARIVS GENERALIS DEI IN TERRIS, VICARIVS FILII DEI and DVX CLERI meaning Vicar General of God on Earth, Vicar of the Son of God and Prince of the Clergy. It will suffice for the scholar a little game of patience, adding the roman numerals found in each papal title to find the same equation of 666, in each one of them.

The book by Otto Kernberg, Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism was ground breaking as it was difficult.

Now with the advance of neuroscience treatment methods have benefited those of us who treat people with this as well as the patient.

How many times faster is the sun producing helium than a car moving at 60 mph?	"The solar wind is currently carrying 1 billion kg/sec away from the Sun. The current ratio of helium to hydrogen is between 2 and 4.5 % by volume.

Does use of the harmonium in a performance compromise on the depth of the exposition of a raga?	"In case of solo performance,
Basic requirement for any instrument to be considered for playing Indian classical music holistically is continuity. In harmonium or any instrument which produces notes in discrete intervals, the notes can not be linked in a continuous manner as opposed to sarangi or vocals. Because of this handicap, a performer won?õ????t be able to do justice to a raga whose essence often lies in smooth slides from one note to another.
Hence, IMO harmonium is not suitable for Indian classical music as a stand alone instrument.

Why does my subwoofer rattle?	"Could be for a variety of reasons. But it boils down to 1 of 2 areas.
The first is that the speaker itself has loose parts. Its generally unlikely, but can certainly happen. Most modern subs are very sturdy, and they are simple as well.

The second is more likely, and is a problem with many car audio installations. Subs move a ton, and generate brutal vibrations at low frequency.

What should I do for my recovering alcoholic 35 year old son who feels like life is not worth living and nothing is worth any effort?	"I completely empathize with your son!
In my 20's I went through a bad breakup right after college that led me to develop a serious gambling addiction for 8 years. Throughout that time I estimated I lost over 200K dollars but that wasn't even the worst part. It was the depression that I struggled with most.
At my lowest I would constantly have thoughts about suicide and even Googled ways to die painlessly. Needless to say it was a very dark period in my life. Whenever I thought about taking my life, there was always a little voice in the back of my head that told me to hang on for one more day.
I didn't really know what that meant or what the next day had in store but I would start to listen to that voice more and more each day. It became my mantra for several years; to just fight to live on for another day.
Then in 2012, I met my fiancee and she gave me the courage to seek help and get better. At the time I was dealing with so many issues such as depression, addiction, financial debt, self-limiting beliefs. In order to solve all of my problems I had to focus on fixing each one at a time until I overcame it.
I started off with trying to fix the gambling addiction since it was the root of all my problems. After 4 months of therapy, I was in a much better place with my addiction and focused next on my financial debt since it was a source of my depression and self-limiting beliefs.
By working several jobs, saving, and grinding day in and day out, I was able to pay off 50K worth of debt in a little over a year. Without the burden of the debt anymore, I could now focus on my depression.
I'm happy to say now I am completely debt free and in a much happier place mentally. I also haven't placed a sports bet in almost 3 years and have become an entrepreneur to share my story in hopes of helping others. Life feels great because I feel like I can live it on my own terms now.
In the case of your son, I would recommend to help him live and survive each day one at a time.?ˇ Don't try to look too hard into the future because all he can see is a bleak one.?ˇ Instead, work with him to try and enjoy each day as it is.?ˇ He'll have some bad days for sure but hopefully the good ones outweigh the bad ones.
Try to help him look for small wins as well.?ˇ This could be anything that makes him smile even if it's for a second.?ˇ When I was going through my depression, some of things I considered small wins were going on hikes where I get to disconnect and enjoy nature or making it a goal to revise my resume and then actually getting it done.?ˇ Eventually all of these small wins will add up to a big win and that's when you're son will start to change his outlook on life.
If you're interested in learning more on how I turned my life around and the lessons you can use to help your son, I wrote a book about it:

What was the original number of the beast: the commonly known 666 or the newly discovered 616?	"One of the earliest controversies in the early church revolved around this number. According to Irenaeus there were some who favored the number 616 and used gematria?õ????a method for numerical calculation used in popular mysticism?õ????to arrive at the name of an emperor. Irenaeus rejected this approach as a serious error. He tried instead to connect 666 to the Old Testament using multiple references to scripture (adding up 600, to 60, and 6).
According to New Testament scholar Richard Bauckham, the ""gematria"" solution?õ????rejected almost immediately by church authorities in the second century?õ????was revived by German scholars in 1831. Scholars have been squabbling about which emperor it must refer to?õ????the names Nero and Caligula in particular can both equal 666?õ????ever since.
I believe the original number was 666, because 616 is an exegetically insignificant number, but 666 is explicitly associated with Solomon?õ????s money and idolatry in the Old Testament (where it appears twice). 666 was also cited in this connection by the Jewish historian Josephus, who was writing in the same general decades as the Revelator. In his commentary on Revelation, G.K. Beale suggested this connection is plausible, though he offered several other plausible solutions as well (for example, the Greek word ?õ????BEAST?õ???ù adds up to 666 using gematria). The first authority to explicitly register 666 as an Old Testament reference was apparently the Venerable Bede in the eighth century.

Why is BJJ so effective?	"On a technical level, it?õ????s effective because it?õ????s a very well-developed art that has been refined over decades of pressure testing.
Furthermore, practitioners are (were?) effective because they tend(ed?) to do the real thing rather than some watered down copy, and they tend(ed?) to train seriously.
But here we have to ask: effective for what?
For the UFC? Partly because the rules (even in UFC 1) were made to stack the odds in favour of the groundfighter. But also because its characteristics make it pretty awesome for many extant formalized dueling contexts; anyone not prepared to face a decent grappler is going to quickly get thrown or otherwise taken down, and then it?õ????s the grappler?õ????s game. Though you may have noticed things have been changing and BJJ hasn?õ????t dominated for a very long time now.
For regular law enforcement? Because police officers get into situations perfect for BJJ on a frequent basis.
For ?õ????street fights?õ???ù without rules? Er?õ???? not so much. If someone has friends nearby waiting to kick your head in, or if they have a concealed knife, the last thing you want to do is to hug him and stay in one spot on the ground. This is not to say BJJ is useless in this context - it definitely is not - but BJJ is hardly the most important skill set for this situation.
BJJ is pretty great and it?õ????s a lot of fun. It?õ????s just not some sort of magic bullet like the fanboys would have you believe.

Don't rely only on the degree (this Engineering or BCA will fetch me a job) what you study? as the world is running towards startups, you can accumulate all these skills outside your college and by the time you complete your degree, you can definitely shine.

Do you think children must learn folk art and craft in schools?	"Must learn? Maybe not. But enrichment activities such as art, music, sports and other activities have been shown to boost academic performance, because they teach different, but complementary types of thinking and acting. Music is closely related to mathematics, and things like proportion, relationships and gross and fine motor skills can be developed through the arts. If taught well, these activities can also enhance socialization skills when children work in groups, and problem solving, when they are asked to create crafts with specific goals.
Also, it?õ????s easy to relate art projects to other subjects, allowing children to research new information and incorporate it in their projects. paintings and drawing can be related to what they are learning in language classes by asking them to illustrate a story. Books can be re-written as plays, and children can write original songs and create costumes and sets related to the book, reinforcing the learning. This can be done across the curriculum, so that every subject is reinforced by some sort of non-academic activity that is fun, physical and informative.
An enriched curriculum allows teachers to use more effective methods of instruction. Students who are only exposed to lecture and response learning retain much less (about 5%-10%) of the information, as opposed to students engaged in active learning projects. The arts are excellent places to incorporate inquiry and active learning techniques.

Do good Mumbai companies come to CDAC Pune?	"Thnks for A2A!
Firstly, I would like to point the ambiguity in your question. When you say Mumbai based companies, do you mean that the companies which give their posting as Mumbai or the companies which are based out of Mumbai?
In CDAC placements, everything depends on TPO. The companies which you will be attending depend upon your profile background. The company selects you on the basis of what answers you give in the interview. If you are worried that you?õ????ll get place of posting other than Pune, you can either turn down the opportunity or grab it. If you are turning down the opportunity, do it only when you are sure you can grab the next one.
Regarding Mumbai based companies, I can?õ????t share much for that fact. Because each company?õ????s way of handling matters is different than others, its upto their sleeves whether they want their head office as Mumbai or Pune or any other city in India. You really cant judge a company based on its base location. Only when you start working for it is when you know what happens in a company remains inside a company.

Are commercial aircraft designed to float on water?	"No, airliners are not designed to float, but they do have features designed to make them sink reasonably slowly, so passengers and crew have time to get into the life-rafts. These features work well if the pilot still has control of the plane as it crash-lands on water, but they won?õ????t work if the plane nose-dives into the sea.
Designing an airliner to float on water using current technology would make it much more expensive and it would be able to carry a lot less. This would drive up air fares by a huge amount (perhaps 40% or so). Since airliners rarely crash passengers would not be willing to pay the extra cost of an air-fare on the off chance that they might end up crash-landing in the sea. Airliner manufacturers concentrate on trying to reduce the chances of an accident and only as a secondary case make the plane able to survive one. This is a better use of the limited budget.

What is the most Indian thing ever?	"In my opinion it must be
Despite being one of the oldest civilizations of the world dating back to thousands of years, India has managed to retain her cultural mooring almost intact, while many other comparable civilizations or cultures have either totally vanished from the face of the earth or at least lost their identity beyond recognition. This could not have been possible without the twin virtues of
From time immemorial Indian subcontinent has accommodated and assimilated diverse strands of philosophies and different races of people, and has managed to turn each one of them into an integral part of the same Indian consciousness or ethos. Apart from the various schools of Hinduism including atheism and hedonism, India had welcomed and embraced many other religious beliefs like Jainism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism,Islam, Sikhism, and Christianity, and woven them into the fabric of Indian cultural mosaic. Despite having such a diversity of regions and a profusion of languages India has managed to infuse a sense of belonging into each of these religions/regions/cultures or linguistic groups, without either obliterating them or letting them over run the basic Indian spirit. Thus we have Indian muslims or Indian christians, but not a Muslim India or a Christian India. We have Indian Tamils, Indian Maharashtrians and Indian Bengalis, but not a Tamil India,Maratha India or a Bangla India. India has thus managed to be

So is a data structure actually an algorithm that describes how to organize things?	"In functional programming, yes.
OK, that sounds rather academic. But?õ????
In Haskell, yes. Here?õ????s how you can describe a linked list data structure in Haskell:
That?õ????s actually all you need to do to write your own List module in Haskell (because pattern matching will let you get values out of the list again). If you put that line in to a Haskell program, then
Creates a list containing just one element (the number 1).
Gives you a list with two numbers in it. If you assigned that list to a variable named
Adds 3 to the beginning of the list.
As I said, that?õ????s all you need to have written to create a linked list in Haskell. Pattern matching (which I won?õ????t go into here) lets you
Actually, you only need the first two options. If you have those two abilities, you can do anything else you want with a list (take the nth element, discard n elements, take the first n elements, multiply every element in the list by 3, whatever).
So all you needed was that one line, which defines the data structure by the ways you can create it. It?õ????s impossible to create an incorrect list, because only the correct ways to create it are available. The actual Haskell Data.List module provides a bunch of convenient functions to save you some effort, but it didn?õ????t
So it is certainly possible to look at data structures as ?õ????functions that organise things?õ???ù. It?õ????s a very clean, totally coherent and reliable way to think about them. Most programming languages don?õ????t make that possible, sadly.

Is Sunil Grover overreacting to the fight with Kapil Sharma by not coming back on the show?	"May be Yes. I never wanted them to be apart.
What Kapil did was just ugly and can?õ????t be tolerated. But now what Sunil is doing, he is enjoying the Tamasha (drama). Sunil now thinks all of this as a drama and fully enjoying it.
They had fights earlier and they resolved them. Kapil apologised many times to him in public and it needs real guts to do so. At least give him a chance. He gave you the opportunity to join again and accepted you with full heart, when you left the show previously. You failed miserably, Sunil because of fan support.
But now game has changed, things have turned favoring you. Now you have a great fan support. Sunil did not hesitate to say that He is more popular than Kapil. You are enjoying because you have the sympathy of people.
Kapil turned out to be a villain after the flight incident. People rejected the show not only because they hate Kapil but also because they have sympathy with Sunil. Kapil apologized to sunil several times because he realized his mistake and don?õ????t forget he was drunk. Sunil deserves a lot respect and I agree with it fully and Kapil?õ????s offensive behavior is not forgivable.
But you call each other as close friend?õ????s. If a friend makes any mistake, it is duty of another friend to forgive him. You punished him harder, his image of a super star is over fore night. People started hating him. Now you are even. If not, talk to him and put your conditions. Atleast give him a chance so that he can prove that he made a mistake and now ready to realize it by heart.
Suppose if this incident was not leaked into the media. Would you have left the show ? I bet NO. Because you would not have the support of the public then. You would have acted accordingly taking into consideration of your career. You would have sticked to the show. Now that scenario is changed you are behaving the same as Kapil by calling it all a TAMASHA. (Drama). You have become arrogant, because now you have lot of offers to pursue.
Few statements from Sunil that shows his sheer arrogance
?õ????
Remember, it is public and it has the capability to forgive. They forgive Salman Khan despite of his various unlawful acts. One day they will forgive Kapil also. What about you, You have tried your show earlier and you failed badly. What is the guarantee that people will extend their support to your new show ? Kapil survived beautifully without you when you left ?õ????Comedy Nights with Kapil?õ????.
I want both Kapil and Sunil to work together and start a new inning providing equal respect to each other. I love watching you both on the same screen. You are strong in a pack and may fall apart without one another. Kapil is a self made man. He worked hard to reach such a height in bollywood and TV. He gave a million reasons to smile to his show viewers. At least he deserve a second chance.
Each time I try and visualise the mid-air brawl between Kapil Sharma and team, I why wonder why there is no video (or even audio) of it. I find it hard to believe that no one recorded this fight on their mobile phone, that there's only an eye-witness' account of it. After all, the drama must have gone on for some time. It started with abusing, there was allegedly a shoe thrown, and a lot of slapping ...and no one made a video of it? There is an audio recording of even SRK's notorious Wankhede Stadium outburst. Very baffling. Is it a planned story?
Where is Chandan Prabhakar? Where is Kapil Sharma? Why no official statements are made from the team regarding the feud except few apologies? Where is Ali Asgar? No one saying anything? Sunil is enjoying the drama, Why? Fight only for eating before Kapil?
Kapil Sharma is the rags-to-riches story that inspired many, even cynics. Boy from small-town Amritsar comes to Mumbai to participate in a comic reality show, wins it for a record 6 seasons, starts his own show which hits it out of the stadium in no time at all, and before you know it, Kapil Sharma becomes the first TV actor to be on
Tellyland has decided to pull down its superstar. He is late on sets, unprofessional, his time's up, is the judgement. People generally don?õ????t like if someone hits huge towards success. If they get a chance they try with all forces to drag him down.
Kapil is a self made man and can?õ????t be kept down for long. He will rise again and I am sure about it.
If that person is my best friend. Yes, I will forgive him if he is apoloziging with all heart. Also I know, that person is suffering a lot of humiliation and on the merge of losing what he has acheived. If I accept the apology and the person is ready to change, all things will be okay. I will happily forgive him to start a new inning of our friendship. That is what I think.
Thanks for A2A

How does a person's character change after adolescence?	"Well, as I am technically still an adolescent, I can?õ????t speak with certainty. But I can tell you what I?õ????ve observed.
For most, adolescence is a time of very restricted feelings. As expectations and responsibilities increase, the mind and body change, until they?õ????re almost unrecognizable. At its core, adolescence is about establishing what your personality is, or who you are.
After adolescence, you tend to figure it out and settle comfortable into it. You know what you like and experimentation is for fun and light interest as opposed to massive personal shifts.
However, many adolescents today have this crucial part of life stunted, as school and pressure clamps down on them. It forces them to simply put one foot in front of the other, and this leads to the angst that we see commonly from teenagers.
Then, after high school when they should be choosing a path, they have no real knowledge of who they are or want to be, and flounder pick something that is unsuitable.

How does ISIS raise money?	"ISIS makes between $1 million and $2 million each day from oil sales, the oil comes mostly from refineries and wells that ISIS controls in northern Iraq and northern Syria. The militants smuggle oil into southern Turkey, for example, and sell it to people who desperately need it just to carry on some semblance of everyday life. ISIS is estimated to produce about 44,000 barrels a day in Syria and 4,000 barrels a day in Iraq, according to
In 2012, the U.S. Treasury Department estimated that al Qaeda and its affiliates had accumulated $120 million from ransoms over the previous eight years.
ISIS was once aligned with al Qaeda. The two groups are thought to operate separately but share similarities.

The United States has a policy of not doing that, and the recent executions of U.S. and other Western ISIS hostages have sparked debate over whether that should change.

That is, after all, what the militants have claimed to be after -- a caliphate, or an Islamic state led by one person, a successor to the Prophet Mohammed.
States demand taxes. In ISIS-controlled areas, to get anything done -- or to survive -- the people pay a fee to the terror group. Businesses are taxed if they want to have essential things like electricity and security, experts say.
Drivers who want to move through a checkpoint must hand over cash.
ISIS has stolen money, too. In June 2014, the group raided several banks in Mosul and stole an estimated $500 million, though the full amount is unconfirmed, according to global intelligence firm Stratfor. In Syria, ISIS has seized control of oil facilities, taking over from rebel group al-Nusra, which didn't fight back.

Why doesn't France adopt true democracy?	"If your question is philosophical in nature: My answer is:
Because True democracy is an abstract concept that can be approached (the best approaches are achieved when very few participants are involved) but never achieved. The Vth republic as semi-presidential representative republic with universal suffrage of the citizen above 18, is a satisfactory approximation of true democracy for me and millions of French Citizen.

What is the best treatment for cavities between my teeth?	"This depends upon the location,depth of decay,your preferences for materials and longevity of the restoration. If the lesions (cavities) are small they can usually be handled with composite resin or a glass ionomer or hybrid material. Many dentists continue to place amalgam fillings which I think are fine . There haven't been any bona-fide studies demonstrating that they are harmful to patients .I do think that long term, amalgam which can undermine sound tooth structure may lead to cracks in the teeth if the cavities are very large.Amalgam tends to go through thermal cycling meaning hot, cold ,hot ,cold ,it expands and contracts at a different dimension than the tooth.
For larger cavities that undermine tooth walls and cusps, a better choice might be a cast onlay or crown. My personal preference would be gold but other materials such as porcelain or resin or one of the newer materials like zirconia or lithium disilicate would be more esthetic choices .So again you need to discuss these choices with your dentist and make the best decision based on your needs .

"If you have already studied luxury brand management, do you require an MBA?"	"Not necessary unless you start working for luxury brand.
Now a days all HR needs MBA and that too full time. Make sure if you are doing then it should be from a good college. ( note: this is for regular job seekers)
Coming to your question: Not required. Just look for opportunities to work with luxury brands. I know few of my friends who did luxury brand management, they are now working in Paris, Singapore etc.
If you are willing to take up any further education then make sure you do something out of the box in luxury segment only for eg: understanding of Hugh quality textile/raw material etc. Or Digital marketing and luxury, the way ahead.
I'll say MBA not required, go gain real time experience :)

Would a narcissist come back after you say the most horrible things to them after they raged at you?	"Yeah. If anything you would encourage them to do so. Narcissists feed on interpersonal dramas to make them look like ?õ????the calm and resilient ones?õ???? when the chaos is happening all around them. By reacting in that fashion you are merely playing into their mind games to mine ?õ????leverage?õ???? and dirt on you to use for later. To provide them with the ?õ????evidence?õ???? they need to know that they are succeeding in breaking you down psychologically, so that they can exact the ?õ????rights?õ???? to walk all over top of you as a doormat later. The best thing you can do is the opposite. Provide a stony shield that they can?õ????t get around or penetrate and they will be eventually discouraged from acting in such an irresponsible and petty matter (something they are well aware is petty, and is usually ?õ????below themselves?õ???? unless they can get something from it)?õ???? The key is setting boundaries with the narcissist, and sticking tenaciously to them. As their whole pathology circulates around power and influence over others to self serve their needs.

"If it was disrespectful, un-American even, to criticize Barack Obama, why is it OK to outright trash Donald Trump?"	"Nobody sane ever said it was disrespectful or un-American to criticize the President. That's never been a valid argument. The President has been and should always be open to criticism. Our democracy depends on being able to legitimately question our leaders. Key word legitimately. Obama was opposed and demonized from day one, not because of his policies but because of the Republican party's desire to limit him to one term. They created a culture of obstructionism, and subversive racism that's given rise to Trump, and NOW that they're in charge they think everyone should be supportive patriots. They won't admit the mistake, but it will never happen again, mark my words

"In Greek mythology, one figure was punished in the underworld by having his head turned around so that he could only see what lay behind him. Who was this and why was this his punishment?"	"From this question, I am reminded of the myth of Orpheus. He was a masterful musician, whose music supposedly melted the hearts of mortals and immortals alike. When his wife died after falling into a pit of vipers, he went to Hades and wooed him and Persephone into giving him a chance to bring his wife back to life. He had to walk back to the surface of the earth with his wife but he couldn't look back till both of them were on the surface. But, in his anxiety, he looked back when he reached the surface but his wife was still in the Underworld, thus, he lost her for the second and final time.
He died at the hands of some priestesses of Dionysus. He was ripped to shreds.

Can you use a different carrier after rooting your phone?	"More information is needed.
To really answer your answer correctly I need your phone?õ????s make and model.
Phones and carriers are a funny business. Right now there are only a few manufacturers making devices that are capable of operating on all 4 American and most global carriers. Those manufacturers are:
Apple, Motorola, HTC (Google Pixel), Huawei (Google Nexus 6p), LG (Google Nexus 5x) and Sony sometimes does.
There are two kinds of carriers in the US. CDMA based and GSM based. Verizon, Sprint and US Cellular are CDMA Carriers. T-MOBILE and AT&T are GSM Carriers. Most global carriers are GSM.
Right now there aren't many phones out there that can swap carriers freely. A couple of them are:
Nexus 6, Nexus 6p, Nexus 5x, Google Pixel, Motorola MotoX Play, MotoX Pure, Apple iPhone 6&7 (some models) and possibly some other Chinese devices. Most global devices don't bother using CDMA radios since the US is the only place it's needed.
Ok, so the answer to your question is really ?õ????no?õ???ù until I know what device it is, but in the meantime browse over to XDA forums to learn more about your device.

For the first time ever I have both the time and the money to go on a long vacation and I want to make an adventure out of it. Where should I go?	"Hey!
I don?õ????t know about too many places..
India is ideal for a long vacation! In fact, you can?õ????t complete a tour of India in one visit. It is vast and diverse.. The language, cuisine, weather, landscape, culture is different every 200 km or so!
Though I am an Indian and have lived in India since I was born, the rich culture and the diversity amazes me when I travel around!
And, if you?õ????re planning to visit in the summers, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir could be good options!
There are many things one can do in India- Yoga and Meditation, Trekking and adventure sports, Volunteering, just Sightseeing, Photography and the list goes on.. You can explore and choose how you?õ????d like to travel!
(If you plan to visit India, I?õ????d suggest you to visit the towns and rural tourist places rather the bigger cities. I love the smaller towns. they are much simpler and beautiful!)
For your trip, you can club India with Nepal, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia.. All of these places are culturally rich and different from the rest of the world!

Is Na+ reactive?	"No it is not.
Na + has an electronic configuration of (2,8) because it has a total of 10 electrons.
This configuration matches with that of neon which is a noble gas.
Therefore having such a stable octet conguration, Na+ is not reactive.
Comparing Na and Na+, Na is more reactive than Na+ as Na has configuration of (2,8,1).So Na has the tendency to lose electrons and react in order to achieve the stable octet configuration.

"How do I decrease bipolar, increase freedom of choice and get smarter by smart pills?"	"Bipolar is a mental illness that you usually take lithium for. Freedom of choice is completely up to you. It depends on your philosophy, energy and surroundings, and outlook on life. Smart pills are called ?õ????nootropics?õ???ù, and there are like 4?õ????5 different ones that are supposed to be pretty useful. I?õ????ve tried about 3.
The obvious is caffeine, but it?õ????s probably more of a stimulant than a nootropic. A nootropic typically promotes neurogenesis, or brain cell growth. Look at the work done by Timothy Feirriss in his videos to see the nootropics he uses. There?õ????s a mushroom powder and a kind of tea/drink. The mushroom powder is legit. The tea is pretty weak.
Believe it or not, marijuana also has a neurogenetic effect on me as well. It feels like a rush of dopamine, or whatever energizes and motivates me. I dont?õ???? know if this is permanent or if it?õ????ll cause long term damage, but my memory is extremely enhanced when on it and extremely fatigued without it. It?õ????s ok though, because memory is not just stored in our hippocampus or specific region of the brain. It is embedded in our bodies, even if we don?õ????t have our episodic memory available in recall. We are a sum of our habits, and some are impossible to ignore.

What are the best ways to get from Tokyo to Kyoto?	"All depends on time and budget.
Without doubt, the easiest way to do it would be by the Shinkansen (~13,000 yen one way). From Tokyo that would mean boarding at Tokyo or Shinagawa Stations. It takes around 2.5 hrs down to Kyoto JR Station which is itself about a 5-min subway ride from the central parts of the city.
The cheapest way would be by night bus which would take around 9 hrs. You could get seats here for as cheap as 3,000 - 4,000 yen.
If you shop around, flights could also be cheap. One way fares on LCCs like Peach and Jetstar could go as low as 4,000 yen. This would mean flying from Narita/Haneda to probably Kansai Airport. Whilst the fares might be cheap, you?õ????ve got the hassle of getting to/from the airports and all the waiting around that that entails.
You could drive there in around 10 hrs if you know where you?õ????re going. Expect highway tolls of around 10,000 yen. I don?õ????t know what you would need in terms of petrol or how much a rental car would be.
Personally, I?õ????d go with the Shinkansen. It really is the best way, although it is one of the most expensive.

What is the most underrated current aircraft programme? And why?	"Personally, I think it is the Embraer KC-390 program

Is Suboxone a good treatment for opiate addiction?	"There are a lot of psychiatrists in Brooklyn who are embracing buprenorphine treatment. Buprenorphine can also be referred to as suboxone which is a drug to combat the drug addiction. It has another usage as well. Sometimes it is used to treat pain. It gets stuck on the skin when it is found to be administered as a transdermal patch. Usually, it is applied to eight areas of the body such as the upper outer arm, both sides of the chest, upper chest etc. When a patient is going through buprenorphine medication, he should be instructed to rotate the application. It should be instructed so because in this way a single site will not be targeted twice. Buprenorphine can be applied both orally and by injection.
The cost of buprenorphine depends on the administration type. Usually, the cost of the treatment is under $5 for a single dose. In some exceptional cases, it may cost $10 per dose. Manufacturing of the drug also determines the cost of the treatment. The cost of the treatment may include the visit charge of the physician, lab, and diagnostic test charges and for other emergency services such as detoxification.
In suboxone treatment, another ingredient is also used which is naloxone. Buprenorphine may cause opioid dependency like similar narcotic drugs. Like other drugs such as heroin, morphine, buprenorphine may generate an abnormal state of mind in the users. It causes drowsiness and unconsciousness. Therefore, it is clear that it may create mental and physical dependence. Addiction, coming from buprenorphine can take serious form. Therefore, naloxone is used in suboxone to prevent the side effects of buprenorphine. This medication is made of harmony. Buprenorphine reduces the cravings for other drugs while naloxone reduces the chance of side effects.
The drug affects a person not only physically, it ruins the mind too. There is no doubt that there is no alternative to suboxone treatment at this moment. In comparison to other addiction treatments, suboxone is more effective and flexible. But as the problem of addiction is mental also, besides suboxone treatment, counseling is required too. When suboxone doctors treat addiction, they included counseling in the medication. In some cases, patient's family is also given counseling if it is required.
According to the surveys, in the year 2010, around 19,100 Americans died for having opioid overdoses. Suboxone has reduced the number no doubt. But this is not possible for any medication to destroy the disease entirely as the problem is rooted from one's mind. Therefore, each individual should be aware. More awareness campaigns should be arranged. The government should take proper steps to prevent addiction. The United States is perhaps the worst victim of drug addiction.

Should Disney bring Starkiller back to Canon and then kill him somehow? Would it be good if they take away some of his force abilities?	"I don't really see a need for him at this point. Though there really was never actually a need for him. He was produced to be marketable first and foremost, not to fill a void in the larger
If they were to bring him back into Canon in some capacity, I think that fans of the character would probably find themselves disappointed with the trade offs they'd need to make. It's not his force powers that are the problem. It's that his narrative purpose has been fulfilled by other characters. He can't form the alliance anymore. He can't be Vader's only force sensitive agent. He can't rescue a bunch of senators and proto rebels from the Death Star while it's still under construction. And once you separate the character from his accomplishments?õ???? you're really not left with much more than a rough concept that's easily interchangeable with a plethora of other characters.

But, in itself, it is not a guarantee that it will ever happen. And if it did, it might end up being a disaster for you.
So my advice is to take classes and practice the arts of both screenwriting and directing. And then start writing and shooting small projects of your own.
And that way you can discover what your specific talents are. And if you can both write and direct, then you will have proof of that.

And since humans aren?õ????t perfect, there will be biases present even though teen users do follow the rules just as well as adult users.
However, there happens to be a trend of teen users getting (on average) more BNBR warnings than adults despite following the rules. A lot of these unfair reports occur because Quora moderation seems to have a bias against its younger users or because people report incessantly if they do not like a certain user.
Not only does this sort of discrimination censor certain opinions of younger people, but it?õ????s essentially stating that teen Quorans do not ?õ????matter?õ???ù. And by devaluing teens, Quora is simply going to create more divisions in their attempt to promote their own biases.
